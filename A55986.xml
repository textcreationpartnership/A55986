         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Midſt the throng of Hiſtorians, we have very few who were perſonally concerned in the actions they write of: few having, like <hi>Caeſar,</hi> wrote their own Commentaries: Nay, the greateſt part were not then in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and ſo their Reports are but Conjectures, and their Books, tranſmitted to Poſterity, are their Divination ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than their Hiſtory. And, alaſs, thoſe few who were Contemporary to their own ſtory, how biaſed are their Traditions! how are they commonly ſo faction'd and ſided, that their Relations are but their Intereſts; deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downwards not what they knew; but what they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to. And if any one amongſt them be ſo unbiaſed, that he have no partial bent of his own, yet the awe which Princes or Generals have upon him, makes him many times fear, that his Truth ſhall be his Gaol, or Exile; all which conſidering, the wary Author writes not a Hiſtory, but his own Safety. But <hi>Procopius</hi> (as every one knows) was not onely alive in the times which he wrote of, but did for many yeares ſurvive not onely the finiſhing of his Hiſtory, but the publication alſo; and was a very material concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Agent in all theſe Wars. And for his Impartial writing, take firſt his own word for it, where he ſaies about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of all, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>He conceived indeed that Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence was decent in an Oratour, and that Poets might be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for their Fables, but an Hiſtorian muſt vent nothing but Truth:</hi> And then he goes on; <hi>Wherefore he hath not ſpared his deareſt friends, and be their faults committed upon what terms they will, he fails not to charge them home with them.</hi> But if his own aſſertion will not ſerve the turn, goe but along
<pb facs="tcp:50471:4"/>with him in his Hiſtory, and thou ſhalt ſee, that (while <hi>Agathias</hi> and <hi>Epiphanenſis,</hi> two learned Writers, about the ſame time with <hi>Procopius,</hi> who if they chance to let any thing fall to the diſcredit of <hi>Justinian,</hi> or the Senators, they do it with exceeding great temper and caution, were yet fain to conceal their Commentaries with <hi>Mauritius</hi> the Emperour) <hi>Procopius</hi> freely layes about him, ſweetens no mans vices, cloaks no mans miſcarriage, but impartially di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſing of <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> and the great ones, doth as much ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, as relate them to poſterity. He ſeverely indites <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Pretorian Proſect</hi> of flat impiety, <hi>Tribomanus</hi> the <hi>Queſtor</hi> of grating avarice, <hi>Arethas</hi> the General for his deceitfull and faithleſs wit; and then he recounts the particular Bands of Souldiers, the ſeveral Garriſons and Cities, which became either a prey to the enemy, or were utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the baſe and unworthy demeanour of <hi>Beſſas, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacius,</hi> and the other <hi>Queſtor.</hi> He ſolemnly rebukes <hi>Verus</hi> for his intemperance, <hi>Sergius</hi> for his haughty diſdain and effeminacy, <hi>Maximinus</hi> for his ſloth, and his general igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in Martial affairs. And which is yet much more than all the reſt, the gallant <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> whoſe wiſe and valiant conduct (to omit his many other glorious atchievements) did reduce two Kings, and brought them captives to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> and to whoſe fame and renown the whole Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory ſeems to be one entire Sacrifice, did but once manage his affairs amiſs, and he hears ſharply of it from <hi>Procopius;</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Beliſarius <hi>then returned to</hi> Conſtantinople <hi>with diſrepute; for during five whole years together, he could gain no footing in</hi> Italy, <hi>but in all that time was forced to waft himſelf by ſtealth from one Port-town to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; whereupon the enemy did ſubdue both</hi> Rome <hi>her ſelf, &amp; all other places with greater ſecurity. And as for</hi> Peruſia, <hi>a chief City in</hi> Tuſcany, <hi>he left it ſtraitly beſieged, and it was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards taken by the enemy, whilſt he marcht for</hi> Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Nor doth <hi>Justinian</hi> himſelf eſcape his chaſtiſement; for he often inculcates his unworthy deteining the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers pay, his ſleepy neglect of Military preparations, and his profuſe reception of the vileſt Barbarian, <hi>Iſdigunas</hi> the <hi>Perſian</hi> Ambaſſadour. How he handles his vices elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, concerns not our preſent purpoſe; but evident it is,
<pb facs="tcp:50471:4"/>that all the countenance and indulgence, all the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and advancements (hereafter mentioned) beſtowed upon him by the Emperour, were looked upon by <hi>Proco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,</hi> as encouragements to ſerve, not ſlatter his Prince; and as the rewards of his Loyalty, not the bribes of his Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. And all this did <hi>Procopius</hi> publiſh, the parties them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves being then alive. Which ſeverity of his, as it cannot chuſe but reconcile a great opinion and commendation of his veracity, ſo is it no emergency of hatred or calumny, but of clear dealing and integrity; not his Satyr againſt the Perſons, but his juſt remorſe for the Vices.</p>
            <p>But though <hi>Procopius</hi> did publiſh this Hiſtory in his own life time, yet it hath ſince been the fate of this (as <hi>Nicolaus Alemannus</hi> obſerves, not of this onely, but of all the other writings of this worthy Author) to be expoſed maime, and mangled to the world. For though it was at firſt preſented to <hi>Juſtinian</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour by <hi>Procopius</hi> himſelf, and by him alſo diſperſed in its native integrity, whereby it became the delight and darling of the whole Empire; Yet this happineſs befell it for many hundred years before Printing was known. For the firſt man that committed it to the Preſs, was <hi>Leonardus Aretinus,</hi> who publiſhed that part of it which doth relate to the <hi>Gothick</hi> Wars; and in that alſo he put a trick upon the World, much misbeſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo learned a man; for he quite ſuppreſſed the Greek copy, and concealing the right Authors name, ſet forth a Latine Tranſlation of his own, pretending it to be a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection compiled by himſelf out of ſeveral Writers, and ſtiling it <hi>De Bello Italico,</hi> A Tract concerning the Wars of <hi>Italy.</hi> Now the Greek Copy of this Tranſlation of <hi>Aretinus</hi> doth <hi>Blondus Flavius</hi> recount to have been by his indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry firſt brought into <hi>Italy.</hi> But he for his part, ſince his copy wants ſome paſſages, of which we are now provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and ſeeing he inveighs againſt ſome things which we find to be currante and juſtifiable, in thoſe Editions which are abroad; was either deluded by the old Manuſcript which he had by him, or elſe by the perſon who tranſlated it for him. For he might very wel have forborn his cenſure, ſeeing he confeſſes himſelf to be altogether ignorant in the Greek Tongue. <hi>Chriſtophorus Perſona</hi> reſenting the injury
<pb facs="tcp:50471:5"/>done to <hi>Procopius</hi> by that Addition of <hi>Leonardus,</hi> did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed reſtore him to his right again, calling the Book by his name, and tranſlating it out of the Original Greek. And yet his Edition alſo is lame and infirm, being deprived of many parts. After all theſe, <hi>Raphael Volateranus</hi> did publiſh in Latine the remaining Books, namely of the <hi>Vandal</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Wars; but he alſo made uſe of as imperfect a Copy as <hi>Perſona</hi> did. So that neither of them, though they were both Library-keepers of the <hi>Vatican</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> did tranſlate out of the <hi>Vatican</hi> Copy.</p>
            <p>And now, Reader, ſince the impoſture of ſome, and the ignorance or misfortune of others, hath till of late deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Author to poſterity either as a ſpurious iſſue, or at beſt a cripple; Conſider how much thou art indebted to the memory of the deceaſed Knight, the learned Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; who hath been ſo carefull to hand it over to thee, not onely rendred in thy own language, that ſo thou mayeſt the better underſtand it; but alſo conferred and examined by the moſt Authentick Copies, that ſo thou mayſt the ſafer credit it. The Greek Edition which he hath tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for thee, is that of <hi>David Hoeſchelius,</hi> who being about to ſet forth this Hiſtory, did firſt furniſh himſelf with three ſeveral Manuſcripts of the ſame Book; one out of the Duke of <hi>Bavaria's</hi> Librarie, the other two ſent him by <hi>Joſeph Scaliger,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac Caſaubon,</hi> both which had undergone their judicious Maſters Caſtigations before. <hi>Hoeſchelius</hi> made choice of the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Copy, finding it the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and entire of the three. But ſo, as where ever he met with any various Readings in the other two, he hath pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them in the Margin.</p>
            <p>In the Tranſlation of theſe Books of <hi>Procopius</hi> into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, Sir <hi>Henry Holcroft</hi> doth exerciſe the ſame judicious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty which <hi>Alemannus</hi> takes to himſelf, in rendring the <hi>Arcana Hiſtoria,</hi> written by the ſame Author, into Latine; not confining himſelf to the ſtrict words of the Author (a courſe taken even by St. <hi>Jerom</hi> himſelf) but giving faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully his ſenſe and meaning: Well knowing, that all Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages have their peculiar Idioms, which being rendred word by word, would make a ſtrange confuſion, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety in that Language into which they are caſt. And
<pb facs="tcp:50471:5"/>though the Learned Knight be not (as I have ſayd) ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinently punctual to match the Author word by word, yet the Reader may be aſſured, that he hath moſt ſeverely purſued his intentions; ſo that if <hi>Procopius</hi> were now alive, and skilled in our Language, it would never repent him, that his Book ſpeakes Engliſh. And though I ſhall not (with <hi>Alemannus</hi>) charge <hi>Procopius</hi> himſelf with the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Tautologies, and too prodigal Periphraſes (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing much to the luxuriance of the Greek tongue) yet I can ſafely aſcertain the Reader, he ſhall find this diſcourſe far more contract and cloſe, than in the Author himſelf; and ſo his expectation ſhall not linger ſo long, e'r it be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the Events: And that nevertheleſs, he ſhall perceive no Material, nor Circumſtance omitted: As the Logicians confined Fiſt doth ſtrike as ſmart, and as tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough a blow, as the diffuſed Orators expanded Palm.</p>
            <p>Where the injury of Time, or neglect of Tranſcribers hath left any breach, or Chaſm in the Greek Copy (which in ſeveral places of this Hiſtory doth unhappily befall) the knowing Tranſlator hath ſupplyed the defect out of the Latine copies. And where the Tranſlator himſelf hath ſuffered any impair, or caſually committed ſome miſtakes, they are both relieved by the able pen of Mr. <hi>Edmund Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mead,</hi> by his exact comparing of the Engliſh with the Greek.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now proceed to acquaint the Reader with ſome farther account of the Author, and this Hiſtory. <hi>Procopius</hi> was born in <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> a City of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> and in the reign of <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> the Emperour came to <hi>Conſtaminople;</hi> where approving himſelf a perſon of excellent parts, general Learning, and exceeding great Prudence, he ſoon turned the eyes of the chiefeſt <hi>Romans</hi> upon him. Inſomuch that <hi>Juſtine</hi> the elder, when his Empire was in very great ſtreights (the <hi>Perſians</hi> being then Victors over the <hi>Romans</hi> in War) did prefer <hi>Procopius</hi> to <hi>Beliſarius</hi> the General, to be of his Counſel. <hi>Suidas</hi> ſtiles him <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, we ſhall not here ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an account of.

               </gap>, were already divul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and known throughout all the <hi>Roman</hi> Dominions. But as to the certain time wherein they were ſeverally publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Writers afford us no certainty. Yet this is moſt certain,
<pb facs="tcp:50471:7"/>that the books of the <hi>Perſian</hi> and <hi>Vandal</hi> Wars, and a great part of the books of the <hi>Gothick,</hi> were finiſhed before the death of <hi>Theodora</hi> the Empreſs, that is, before the 22 year of <hi>Juſtinians</hi> reign: for in his <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> he writes, that he was enforced in this Hiſtory to conceal the trains which <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> laid to deſtroy <hi>Amalaſuntha,</hi> Queen of the <hi>Goths,</hi> for fear of <hi>Theodora.</hi> And likewiſe our Author makes mention of the publication of all the firſt ſeven books, before the 26 of <hi>Juſtinians</hi> Reign, in his eighth book of theſe Wars; which book was written in the 27 of <hi>Juſtinians</hi> Reign.</p>
            <p>But this eight book is not ſo properly called the fourth of the <hi>Gothick</hi> Wars, becauſe it is indeed <hi>Hiſtoria quaedam</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>To conclude, what great profit and delight is like to ariſe to the Reader in peruſing this Hiſtory, let himſelf imagine, when he ſhal meet here with Prudent Letters &amp; Diſpatches from Princes and Generals; Wiſe Laws and Proviſions for the publique Safety; Politick Leagues and Confederacies to ſecure Intereſts; Elegant Speeches and Exhortations to animate the Souldier; Notable Examples of Vices and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; Inevitable Stratagems to circumvent Adverſaries: Lively Deſcriptions of the Scituations of Countries, Cities, Buildings, Hils, Seas, Rivers, and Fountains; Various and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchangeable Turns and Inconſtancies of Wars and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes; in a word, all the Treaſury and Wardrobe that can inrich and beautifie a Hiſtory. Take one only remarkable paſſage concerning the laſt, in that City, which had been long the aim and envy of the world, <hi>Rome</hi> her ſelf. <hi>Alaricus</hi> the <hi>Goth</hi> gains her from the <hi>Romans; Genſerick</hi> the <hi>Vandal</hi> doth force her from the <hi>Goths; Theodorick</hi> the <hi>Goth</hi> regains her to the <hi>Goths; Beliſarius</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> General from the <hi>Goths: Totilas</hi> the <hi>Goth</hi> from the <hi>Romans</hi> again: <hi>Beliſarius</hi> receives her ſackt and forſaken by the <hi>Goths: Totilas</hi> tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs in her ſecond Conqueſt: <hi>Narſes</hi> the Eunuch ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dues both <hi>Tolilas</hi> and her. So that in this very Hiſtory, ſhe is eight ſeveral times loſt, and recovered.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>ROCOPIUS</hi> of <hi>CAESAREA</hi> wrote the Hiſtory of the wars that the Emperour <hi>Juſtinian</hi> had with the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> both Eaſterne and Weſterne, and what the iſſue of them was; that the memory of ſo great Actions might not, through Tract of Time, be buried in Oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and loſt to the Word; The preſervation whereof he conceived might be of very great uſe, both to thoſe that are now living, and to thoſe that ſhall come after; in caſe that time ſhould againe bring about the neceſſity of the like actions in any part of the World. For, the knowledge of a like Hiſtory, ſuiting with that of any other Age, is of great advantage to thoſe that ſhall have to doe with any Wars; in that it informes, what the ſucceſs in the like former Actions hath been, and intimates withall what iſſue the preſent, (ſuppoſing the beſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells being taken) in all probability ſhall have. He was conſcious alſo to himſelfe, that He was the beſt able to write this Hiſtory; though for no other reaſon, yet becauſe He was choſen to be <hi>Aſſeſſor</hi> to <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> the Emperours Generall, and ſo was preſent, in a manner, at all that was done in theſe Wars.</p>
               <p>He conceived further, that as Eloquence became an Oratour, &amp; Fables were proper for Poets, ſo Truth was that an Hiſtoriographer ought chiefely to look at. Therefore he ſpared not to note the Failings even of his neareſt Friends, but gave an exact Account of all their Actions, whether they were well, or ill done. Neither will the Actions of any other Age appeare either of more uſe, or more Gallant, (to him that ſhall but duely conſider them) then thoſe that have paſſed in theſe Wars; for in moſt of them, as wee have been informed, almoſt Miracles have been done. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs a man will needes give the preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence to former Ages, and will not vouchſafe to allow his owne to be able to doe any thing.</p>

               <p>And therefore as in our Armies now we have ſome <hi>Archers,</hi> others <hi>Sword</hi> and <hi>Buckler</hi>-men, and the like names of Souldiers that the Ancients had; yet will not ſome allow any of the Ancient Proweſs and Valour to have deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down to our Age; ſhewing herein how pittifully ignorant they are of the Practiſe of thoſe times. For they doe not at all conſider, that the <hi>Archers</hi> in <hi>Homer</hi>'s time (whoſe Profeſſion grew to be a tearm of reproach) had neither Horſe, nor Javelin, nor Buckler, nor any thing elſe to defend themſelves, but went on foot into the field, and were forced to find ſhelter for themſelves ſome other way, ſheltering themſelves (inſtead of a Buckler) either behind ſome Tomb-ſtone, or Pillar, where neither if they were put to flight, they could be ſafe; nor, if their Enemies fled, could they do them any harm: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did they ever fight in open field, but alwaies, as it were, by ſtealth did, what ever they did. Beſides, the way of their Archery was ſo lamentable, as that drawing their Bow-ſtring to their breaſt, they ſo let their Arrow fly, which, in all probability, could not doe any execution at all, whereſoever it fell. And this was the manner of the ancient <hi>Archery.</hi> But our <hi>Archers</hi> now adaies go into the field, armed with Habergeons, and Greaves that come up as high as their knees. They have beſides their Quiver of Arrows on their right ſide, and a Sword on their left; and ſome of them have a Javelin alſo faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned about them, and a kind of ſhort Buckler, as it were, but without any handle, made faſt to their ſhoulders, which ſerves to defend their head and neck. They are alſo excellently well horſed; and though their horſes run never ſo faſt, they can with caſe ſhoot either way, and annoy their Enemies, either purſuing them, or flying. Beſides, they draw their Bow-ſtring toward their Forehead, up to the right Ear, which gives ſuch force to the Arrow, that where it lights it kils, no Shield nor Corſlet being able to reſiſt the violence. Some, conſidering none of theſe things, onely reverence and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the old times, not allowing any advantage to ſucceeding inventions. But all can be no impediment, but that in theſe Wars great exploits, and moſt famous have been done. Firſt therefore, beginning a little higher, ſhall be declared, what happened between the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> in reference both to their Victories and Loſſes in theſe Wars.</p>

               <p>WHen the Roman Emperour <hi>Arcadius</hi> drew near his deceaſe in <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> having a Son, <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> not yet weaned from the breaſt: He was troubled both for him, and his Empire, how to provide for both. If he ſhould give <hi>Theodoſius</hi> a companion in the Empire, he feared in effect he might prove his Sons Murtherer, ſetting an Enemy upon him armed with ſoveraign power; and if he ſhould leave him alone in it, it was likely ſome taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of his deſolate condition might uſurp the Empire, and deſtroy him. In <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> he had none of his blood to be his Protector; and in <hi>Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> the Uncle, he had no hope he could ſuffice for it; the Affairs of <hi>Italy</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſo ill terms. The <hi>Perſians</hi> no leſs troubled him, leſt deſpiſing the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors childhood, they ſhould ruin the <hi>Roman</hi> Provinces. <hi>Arcadius</hi> in this perplexity, though none of the quickeſt Wits, yet lighted upon a Counſell which preſerved him and his State, whether it were by communication with Wiſemen, which an Emperour cannot want, or by divine Inſpiration. For by his Teſtament he declared his Son his Succeſſor, and <hi>Iſdegerdes,</hi> K. of <hi>Perſia,</hi> his Protector; whom he beſought with his whole power and providence, to preſerve both his Empire and Son.

                  <hi>Vararanes</hi> King of <hi>Perſia</hi> invaded the <hi>Roman</hi> Territories with a great Army; but did no hurt, returning in this manner. <hi>Anatolius</hi> was ſent the Emperors Ambaſſador to the <hi>Perſian,</hi> who being come near the Army, leaped from his Horſe, and alone, and afoot, went towards <hi>Vararanes,</hi> who demanded of the company, who this was; they ſaid, it was the <hi>Roman</hi> General. The King amazed at the exceſſive ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, turned his horſe, and rode away, and after him his Army. Being in his Country, he entertained the Ambaſſador with much curteſie, and yeelded to the terms of peace he deſired, That neither ſhould erect any new Fortification near the others boders; which if it were done, gave either ſide opportunity of doing what they pleaſed.</p>

                  <hi>Creaghters,</hi> as other <hi>Hunnes;</hi> but are ſeated in a good Land; Neither make they any Inroads in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Roman</hi> Territories, but onely with the <hi>Perſian</hi> Armies. Theſe onely <hi>Hunnes</hi> have white bodies, and viſages not uncomely; and their courſe of life is not as of the reſt, brutiſh; being under one King in a lawfull govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and dealing juſtly with themſelves and neighbours, no leſs than the <hi>Romans,</hi> or any other people. Their Rich men have each twenty or more companions, to be their perpetual Camerades, and to partake in a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of their goods. When any Principals die, the Retainers uſe to be put into the ſame grave with them. <hi>Perozes</hi> invading theſe <hi>Ephthalites, Euſebius</hi> then Ambaſſador from the Emperor <hi>Zeno</hi> was with him. The <hi>Ephthalites</hi> made ſhew to be much affraid, and betook themſelves to flight, and with much haſt ran into a place compaſſed with ſteep mountains, and covered with thickets; between the mountains is a broad way, reaching far, with no way out, but ſtill continuing in the ſame circle. <hi>Perozes</hi> ſuſpecting no fraud, nor conſidering he went in a ſtrange Country, purſued without looking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; ſome few of them flying before him, but the moſt hiding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Faſtneſſes, who now had the back of the Enemy; and would not yet appear, that the <hi>Perſians</hi> might be ſo far engaged within their Ambuſhes, and the Mountains, that they ſhould not be able to retreat. Which the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> apprehending (the danger now beginning to appear) were ſilent for fear of <hi>Perozes,</hi> but they deſired <hi>Euſebius</hi> to admoniſh the King (who ſaw not the ill terms he was come to) rather to adviſe upon ſome way to eſcape, than to hazard thus impertinently. <hi>Euſebius</hi> told not <hi>Perozes</hi> the danger, but this tale; That a Lion once ſpyed a Goat bleating, and tyed upon a bank, and ran to make his dinner of him, but fell into a deep hole, which had in it a round narrow path without any way out, framed purpoſely by the owners of the Goat, which they ſet over it, to bait the Lion into a ſnare. <hi>Perozes</hi> at this tale grew affraid, leſt the <hi>Perſians</hi> purſued their own miſchief, and ſo went no further, but called a Council what to doe. The <hi>Hunnes</hi> now in ſight, had guarded the entrance, that none might goe out. The <hi>Perſians</hi> then cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeeing the diſaſter, lamented; no hope appearing to avoid the danger. The King of the <hi>Ephthalites</hi> ſent to reproach <hi>Perozes</hi> for his ſenſleſs raſhneſs, in thus fooliſhly ruining himſelf and his people; but promiſed the <hi>Hunnes</hi> ſhould grant them their lives, if <hi>Perozes</hi> would adore him (being now his Lord) and ſwear his Country oath, that the <hi>Perſians</hi> ſhould no more invade the <hi>Ephthalites. Perozes</hi> conſulted with the <hi>Magi,</hi> whether theſe conditions were to be yeelded to; Who anſwered, that for the Oath he might doe what he pleaſed, but in the other he ſhould delude the Enemy by a trick: They had a cuſtom each morning to adore the riſing Sun; that he obſerving duly the hour, ſhould meet the King of the <hi>Ephthalites,</hi> with his face to the riſing Sun, and ſo adore, avoyding by this the diſgrace. <hi>Perozes</hi> accordingly ſwore the peace, and adored his Enemy, and then went home with his Army.</p>

               <p>BUt not long after <hi>Perozes,</hi> neglecting his Oath, reſolved to revenge this ſcorn; and aſſembling from all his Dominions both <hi>Perſians</hi> and Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates, he went againſt theſe <hi>Hunnes;</hi> of his thirty Sons leaving onely <hi>Caba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> behind him, then grown a man. The <hi>Ephthalites</hi> hearing of it, and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to be ſo deceived, reviled their King, for betraying their Affairs to the <hi>Perſians.</hi> He ſmiling, demanded, what Affairs he had betrayed? whether their Country, or Arms, or Goods? They replyed, Nothing, but our oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, upon which all other things depend; urging him preſently to goe meet the Enemy. But the refuſed, the Invaſion being yet not certain, and the <hi>Perſians</hi> ſtill in their own Country; and ſtaying where he was, he did this. Upon a Plain, through which the <hi>Perſians</hi> were to enter his Country, he digg'd in a great ſpace of ground a deep pit, extreme broad, leaving in the middle a narrow paſſage, for ten Horſe a breaſt; over the pit he laid Reeds, and upon the Reeds Turfs, which concealed the ſuperficies: And he directed his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, running from the Enemy, to keep cloſe, and few in rank upon the firm ground, and to beware of the pit. On his Royal Palace alſo he hung out his <hi>Halas,</hi> or Gods, by whom <hi>Perozes</hi> ſwore, and breaking his Oath, invaded now the <hi>Hunnes.</hi> While the Enemy were in their own Country, he ſtirred not, but hearing by his Scouts, they were come to <hi>Gorgo</hi> (being in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt border of <hi>Perſia</hi>) and marching toward him; himſelf with moſt of his Army ſtayd ſhort of the pit, ſending out ſome to ſhew themſelves upon the Plain at a good diſtance, and no ſooner ſeen by the Enemy, but to retreat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, remembring the pit. They did ſo, and (at the pit going few in rank) came clear to the Army. The <hi>Perſians</hi> not imagining the plot, purſued fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly upon full ſpeed, it being in an open Plain, and ſo fell into the pit, not onely the foremoſt of them, but the rear alſo; for purſuing furiouſly, they perceived not the miſchief of thoſe in the front, but falling on them with Horſes and Lances, killed them, and were deſtroyed for company. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom was <hi>Perozes,</hi> and all his Sons. They ſay, being ready to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this pit, he took a Pearl hanging at his ear, a moſt fair one, and of infinite value, and caſt it away, that none might hereafter wear ſo beautifull a Piece, as no King was ever maſter of the like; but to me the report ſeems not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, for one in ſuch a ſuddain diſtreſs to have his mind upon ought elſe. I rather think his car was cut off, and the Pearl conveighed away. The <hi>Roman Emperor</hi> endeavoured to buy it of the <hi>Ephthalites,</hi> but they could not find it, though they took much pains in the ſearch. Some ſay, they found it, and ſold another to <hi>Cabades</hi> for it. The <hi>Perſians</hi> ſtory of this Pearl is remarkable, and not altogether incredible. They report, that this Pearl lying in a Scallop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh, not far from the Sea-ſhore in <hi>Perſia,</hi> both the ſhels opened, and in the midſt lay the Pearl, a moſt goodly ſpectacle: No where was found any thing to reſemble it in bigneſs, or beauty, ſince the world was. Upon this beauty doted a huge fierce Dog-fiſh, following without quitting it day or night: Being to ſeek his food he would hunt for it, and having found it, ſnatch it up, and haſtily devour it; then to his Scallop-fiſh again, to fill himſelf with that beloved ſight. Which a Fiſherman once obſerving, but fearing the Fiſh, he durſt not venture on it, but made the relation to King <hi>Perozes,</hi> who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon long'd to have the Pearl, importuning the Fiſherman with fair words, and great hopes; and he yeelding to the requeſts of his Lord, is reported to have ſayd to him; <q>O my Liege, 'tis true, Wealth is deſirable, and life more; but above all a mans children are precious; for whoſe ſake nature forces a man to do any thing. I will venture upon this fiſh, and hope to make you maſter of this Peal. If I come off victorious, 'tis likely I ſhall be ranked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the happy men of the time. Doubtleſs you, being a King of Kings, will beſtow great wealth on me. And ſhould I get no reward, it is enough I have been my Prince's benefactor. If I be devoured, be it your part, Sir, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence my children for their fathers death: So ſhall I have my reward
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50471:10"/>in thoſe neareſt to me; and your glory will be greater, doing good to me in my children, for which I cannot give you thanks. That onely is pure gratitude, which is ſhewen to the dead.</q> Having thus ſaid, he departed. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the place where the Scallop uſed to ſwim, and the Dog-fiſh to follow, he ſate upon a Rock, watching to get the Pearl alone from her Lover. At laſt the Dog-fiſh finding a fiſh for his repaſt, fell aboard. The Fiſherman left thoſe who attended him, and making after the Scallop, caught it, and haſted to ſhore; which the Dog-fiſh perceiving, came to the reſcue: The Fiſherman, though not far from ſhore, finding he ſhould be ſurpriſed, threw the Scallop on land, and preſently was caught and devoured. His atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants aſhore took the Pearl, and brought it to the King, relating what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened. Thus the <hi>Perſians</hi> report of this Pearl. But to return to my former diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Perozes</hi> and his Army thus overthrown (for who eſcaped the pit, fell into the enemies hand) the <hi>Perſians</hi> made a Law; Not to follow the chaſe upon the full ſpeed, though the enemy run away in that kind. As for the reſt, that went not in this expedition, they choſe for their King,<note n="*" place="margin">Cabades <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> in Anno Domini 486.</note> 
                  <hi>Cabades,</hi> the yong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt Son of <hi>Perozes,</hi> onely ſurviving. And they were under the <hi>Ephthalites</hi> two yeares, and paid them tribute; untill <hi>Cabades,</hi> more confirmed in his kingdome, refuſed it: who afterwards governed Tyrannically, and made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Alterations, and a Law; That the <hi>Perſians</hi> ſhould have their women in common: which the Commons miſliked, and taking arns depoſed him, and kept him in priſon, and choſe <hi>Blaſſes</hi> King, the brother of <hi>Perozes,</hi> all his other Sons being dead: For of a private race the <hi>Perſians</hi> might not chuſe a King, if the blood Royal were not quite extinct. <hi>Blaſſes</hi> ſucceeding, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the chief men of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and propounded in counſell touching <hi>Cabades,</hi> whom the multitude would not endure to be put to death. Many ſeverall opinions being ſpoken, <hi>Guſanaſtades,</hi> a principall man, and by Office a <hi>Chanaranges</hi> (which with them is a Generall) who had his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment bordering upon the <hi>Ephthalites,</hi> ſhewing his knife, ſuch as the <hi>Perſians</hi> uſe to pare their nails with, as long as a mans finger, and the third part of an inch thick; <q>See this knife, ſaid he, a very ſhort one; yet can it doe that now, which within a while twenty thouſand armed men will not be able:</q> Intimating, that if they did not kill <hi>Cabades</hi> now, he would get abroad, and trouble them again. But they thought it not fit to kill one of the blood Royall, but rather to keep him in the Tower of <hi>Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion;</hi> where if a man be impriſoned, it is not lawfull to mention him; once to name him, is death; from whence the <hi>Perſians</hi> gave it that name.</p>

               <p>THe <hi>Armenian</hi> Hiſtories report, that once this Law of the Tower of <hi>Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion</hi> was broken, thus. There was a cruel War between the <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Armenians,</hi> for thirty two years, in the Reigns of <hi>Pacurius</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and <hi>Arſaces</hi> King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> of the race of the <hi>Arſacides.</hi> This war con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing, both were brought low, eſpecially the <hi>Armenians.</hi> But being both diſtruſtfull, neither ſent Heralds to his adverſary. In the mean time the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> fell into a war with other <hi>Barbarians,</hi> inhabiting near the <hi>Armenians;</hi> who to make demonſtration of their affections to a peace, invaded thoſe people, acquainting the <hi>Perſians</hi> therewith; and coming unexpected, ſlew moſt of their men. <hi>Pacurius</hi> pleaſed with the proceeding, ſent to invite <hi>Arſaces,</hi> giving him his faith. And being come, he entertained him with much curteſie, and as a brother, uſed him with all terms of equality: and having mutually ſworn amity and confederacy between the <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians,</hi> he diſmiſt him. A while after, <hi>Arſaces</hi> was accuſed to attempt innovations, and <hi>Pacurius</hi> beleeving it, again ſent for him, to communicate of their common affairs.

They thought it not fit to condemn men denying, and not evidently convinced; but adviſed him a way, to bring <hi>Arſaces</hi> openly to accuſe himſelf.

Upon this the <hi>Magi</hi> condemned him to have violated the truce, and his oath. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curius</hi> cauſed <hi>Baſicius</hi> to be ſtript of his skin, and the ſame filled with chaf to be hanged on a high tree. <hi>Arſaces</hi> he would not kill, being of Royall blood, but impriſoned him in the Tower of <hi>Oblivion.</hi> Not long after an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menian,</hi> a favourite of <hi>Arſaces</hi> (who followed him this laſt journey into <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi>) accompanied the <hi>Perſians</hi> in a war againſt ſome <hi>Barbarians,</hi> wherein he demeaned himſelf valiantly, and was a great means of the victory. Whom <hi>Pacurius</hi> bade demand what he pleaſed, and he ſhould not fail of it. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded onely to doe ſervice to <hi>Arſaces</hi> one day he would make choice of. The King was troubled to break a Law ſo ancient, but to keep his word, granted his requeſt, who by the Kings permiſſion being in the Tower, adored <hi>Arſaces;</hi> and both embracing each other, made a kind of ſweet lamentation of their fortunes, with much adoe untwining themſelves. Having had their fill of mourning, the <hi>Armenian</hi> bathed <hi>Arſaces,</hi> dreſt him, and put on him the Royall habit, and placed him upon a couch; where <hi>Arſaces</hi> feaſted the company Princely, as he uſed before. Many diſcourſes paſt in their cups, and things happened delighting <hi>Arſaces;</hi> and the drinking laſting till night, and much joying in each others company, they parted overwhelmed with contentment. Then they report that <hi>Arſaces</hi> ſaid; That having ſpent this the merrieſt day he ever had, with him he loved moſt, he would no more return to the miſeries of life, and then he ſtabbed himſelf with a knife purpoſely taken up at the Feaſt. Thus the <hi>Armenian</hi> Hiſtories relate of <hi>Arſaces,</hi> and that Law of the Tower of <hi>Oblivion</hi> ſo broken. But to return to my matter.</p>
               <p>While <hi>Cabades</hi> was in priſon, his Wife attended on him, bringing him neceſſaries, whom the Captain of the Tower tempted, being exceeding beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull. Which <hi>Cabades</hi> underſtanding from her, bade her yeeld to him. And the Captain getting her to his bed, became doting in love with her; giving her free acceſs to her Husband, and to retire without impediment. There was alſo a Nobleman named <hi>Seoſes,</hi> a great friend of <hi>Cabades,</hi> who watcht near the Tower for an opportunity to get <hi>Cabades</hi> out; who by his Wife ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed him of horſes and men ready for him not far from the priſon, and In what place. <hi>Cabades</hi> perſwaded his Wife to let him have her garments, and to put on his, and ſtay in his lodging. So <hi>Cabades</hi> got clear of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the Keepers ſeeing him, but taking him for his Wife, and ſo they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtayd, nor troubled him. In the morning finding the Wife in the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands chamber and apparel, they took her for him; and the miſtaking pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed ſome dayes, till <hi>Cabades</hi> was got far away. What became of the Lady, (the plot being diſcovered) and how they puniſht her, I have no certainty,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50471:11"/>the <hi>Perſians</hi> therein not agreeing. But <hi>Cabades</hi> ſecretly with <hi>Seoſes</hi> went to the <hi>Ephthalite Hunnes,</hi> and marrying their Kings daughter, brought an Army againſt the <hi>Perſians;</hi> who finding themſelves too weak, fled from the <hi>Hunns. Cabades</hi> coming where <hi>Guſanaſtades</hi> was Governour, ſaid to ſome, that that <hi>Perſian,</hi> which that day firſt came to offer his ſervice, he would make <hi>Chana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranges.</hi> But he repented him of his words, remembring the <hi>Perſian</hi> Law, for no Government to be conferr'd upon ſtrangers in blood; but ſuch onely to have the place, to whoſe race it did belong; and he feared, if any preſented himſelf not of the kindred of the <hi>Chanaranges,</hi> that to keep his word he might violate the Law. But by chance his word was kept without injury to the Law; <hi>Adergudunbades</hi> appearing firſt, a young man, coſen to <hi>Guſanaſtades,</hi> and very expert in Martial affairs; who firſt ſaluted <hi>Cabades</hi> his Lord, adored him as King, and beſought him to command him as his ſlave. *So <hi>Cabades</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring the Palace, and finding <hi>Blaſes</hi> unguarded, put out his eyes,<note place="margin">Cabades <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored began</hi> Anno Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni 501.</note> as the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> uſe to malefactors (pouring into them, being kept wide open, boyling oyle; or with a bodkin red hot melting an ointment into the inſide of the eye) and ever after kept him in priſon, after two years reigning <hi>Guſanaſtades</hi> he put to death, and made <hi>Adergudunbades</hi> General. <hi>Seoſes</hi> he made the <hi>Adra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta-daras Salanes;</hi> that is, Superintendant over all Offices and Armies; an office firſt held by <hi>Seoſes</hi> in <hi>Perſia;</hi> None before nor after ever had it. <hi>Cabades</hi> alſo eſtabliſhed and ſecured his Empire, being witty and valiant, no man more.</p>

                     <hi>This War began in</hi> Anno Dom. 503.</note> and into <hi>Armenia</hi> he brought the firſt news himſelf with an Army, forraging the Country. Then, though in the Winter, he ſate down before <hi>Amida,</hi> a City of <hi>Meſopotamia.</hi> The <hi>Amidenſes,</hi> though having no Garriſon (as having lived before peaceably and quietly) and wanting all manner of proviſion, yet ſtood out againſt the dangers and inconveniencies of the Siege. At that time one <hi>James,</hi> a <hi>Syrian,</hi> a juſt, and a very religious man, had for many years been a Recluſe at <hi>Endielon,</hi> a Town diſtant from <hi>Amida</hi> a dayes journey, that ſo he might not be interrupted in his godly contemplations: And the neighbours, to help his good intent, had pitcht a pale about him, with ſpaces wide enough onely to ſee, and conferre with ſuch as came to him; and a roof over him to keep off rain and ſnow. And there he had long continued, not yeelding to heats nor colds, and feeding on roots, and on them not every day, but faſting ſometimes a good while together. Some <hi>Ephthalites</hi> ſcouring the Country, eſpyed this <hi>James,</hi> offered to ſhoot at him; but their hands ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly benummed, could not draw their bows. <hi>Cabades,</hi> hearing the report of it in the Camp, would be an eye-witneſs of the miracle; and ſeeing it, was aſtoniſht, and all the <hi>Perſians</hi> with him: he humbly therefore beſought <hi>James</hi> to remit his mens offence; which he doing at the firſt word, they were inſtantly freed of their fears. <hi>Cabades</hi> then bade him demand ſomething, thinking he would have askt ſome great ſum. But he prayed him only to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow on him ſuch men, as in this war ſhould come to him for protection: Which <hi>Cabades</hi> granted, and left him Letters for their aſſurance. And it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divulged, many from all parts came, and were preſerved.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Cabades</hi> with his Rams battered <hi>Amida</hi> on every ſide, the defendants avoyding the ſtroak of the Engine with croſs beams: And he gave not over, till he found the wall that way impregnable; as not falling, nor ſo much as
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50471:12"/>ſhaking at ſo many ſtroaks: So ſtrong their buildings were in ancient times. Failing therefore this way, he raiſed a Mount, ſo high that it commanded the wall. To which the defendants drew a Mine from the Town, and by carrying out the earth from within the Mount, made it hollow, the outſide keeping the form it had, giving no ſuſpition of any thing to the Enemy. The <hi>Perſians</hi> mounted it, thinking as upon firm ground to ſhoot into the Town; But company preſſing in, the Mount ſunk, and almoſt all periſht. <hi>Cabades,</hi> at this deſpairing, reſolved to raiſe the ſiege, commanding the Army the next day to retire. But the Townſmen now ſecure, flouted the <hi>Barbarians</hi> from their walls; and ſome common women drew up their clothes, ſhewing <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bades</hi> the parts which ſhould not be ſeen by men. Upon this the <hi>Magi</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bade his retreat, aſſuring the King that ere long the <hi>Amidenſes</hi> would ſhew him all their ſecret and hidden things: So the Camp lay ſtill. Some dayes after, a <hi>Perſian</hi> found near one of the Turrets the mouth of an old Vault, onely with a few ſmall ſtones covering it. He entered it a lone in the night, and got within the wall, and when 'twas day, came and told it <hi>Cabades;</hi> who the next night went with ſome of his Army, and ſcaling ladders to the place: where he had a favourable chance. The ſaid Turret was guarded by Monks (the ſtricteſt kind of Chriſtians) who that day obſerved an Annual Feaſt, and at night wearied in their ſolemn aſſembly, having taken a greater proportion of meat and drink than uſuall, they perceived not the Enemy; who entring the Town by few at a time, aſcended the Turret, and killed the Monks being faſt aſleep. Then <hi>Cabades</hi> ſet ſcaling ladders to the wall next the Turret; and day appearing, the <hi>Amidenſes,</hi> who guarded the next Turret, perceiving their danger, came haſtily to the reſcue. Where after a hot conflict on both ſides, at laſt they got the better, killed many of the men already come up, kept off thoſe upon the ladders, and were very near quit of the danger. But <hi>Cabades</hi> drawing his Cimeter, forced his men up the ladders, threatning death to the comers down: And ſo having much the advantage in numbers, they got the better, and took the Town after eighty dayes ſiege. Much ſlaughter was done, till <hi>Cabades</hi> riding into the Town, an old Prieſt of <hi>Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> came to him, and told him; That it was not Kingly to kill men that were at his mercy. <hi>Cabades</hi> yet angry, anſwered, Why then would they ſtand out againſt me? Becauſe, Sir (replyed the Prieſt) God would give you <hi>Amida,</hi> not by our wills, but your own valour. <hi>Cabades</hi> pleaſed with this reply, ſuffered no more execution to be done, but bad the <hi>Perſians</hi> ſack the City, and take priſoners, ſelecting the principall for himſelf. Then leaving a thouſand <hi>Perſians</hi> in garriſon, under one <hi>Glones,</hi> and ſome few wretched Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens to ſerve them in their neceſſaries, with the reſt of his army and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners he went home. To theſe priſoners <hi>Cabades</hi> uſed a princely courteſie; he let them all goe home free, and gave out they ran away. The Emperour <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> alſo dealt liberally with them, remitting the Citties tribute for ſeven years, and deſtowing many benefits upon their City in publique<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and on particular men; ſo that they ſoon forgot their miſeries.

               <p>BUt <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> hearing of the ſiege of <hi>Amida,</hi> immediately ſent forth an Army againſt the Enemy: In which, beſides the Commanders of compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, were Generals, <hi>Areobindus</hi> (who married the daughter of <hi>Olybrius,</hi> late Emperour of the Weſt) Generall of the Eaſt; and <hi>Celer,</hi> Commander of the <hi>Palatine</hi> Cohorts, called by the Romans <hi>Magiſter;</hi> and the two Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals of the Legions in <hi>Conſtantinople, Patritius</hi> the Phrygian, and <hi>Hypatius</hi> the Emperours Siſters Son. Theſe were the four Generals; and with them went alſo <hi>Juſtine,</hi> who was Emperour after <hi>Anaſtaſius,</hi> and <hi>Patriciolus,</hi> with <hi>Vitalianus</hi> his ſon, who afterward rebelled againſt <hi>Anaſtaſius;</hi> &amp; <hi>Pareſmanes</hi> of <hi>Colchis,</hi> an excellent good ſouldier, with <hi>Godidaſclus</hi> and <hi>Sbeſas,</hi> Goths, who

So brave an Army went not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Perſians</hi> before it, nor ſince. They marcht not together: Every General led his own forces. The Praefect, or Commiſſary of Proviſion for the Army, was <hi>Appion</hi> an Egyptian, a principal Patrician, and valiant, whom the Emperour declared his partner in the Empire by a Patent, that he might have abſolute authority in the expenſe of the army: which being long in levying, &amp; marching but ſlowly, found the <hi>Perſians,</hi> after this curſory invaſion, gone home with their ſpoils. The Generals would not beſiege <hi>Amida,</hi> hearing it to be abundantly provided with all neceſſaries; but were earneſt to make an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion into the Enemies Country. And they marcht not in one body, but encamped ſeverally. <hi>Cabades</hi> being near, and knowing this, entred the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> borders.

But <hi>Patricius</hi> and <hi>Hypatius,</hi> having met eight hundred <hi>Ephthalites</hi> marching before the <hi>Perſian</hi> army, had killed them all; and not dreaming of the army with <hi>Cabades,</hi> were paſſing their time merrily like Conquerors, laying down their arms and preparing for dinner. And they were waſhing their meat in the brook there, and ſome troubled with heat were bathing, which made the water run foul. <hi>Cabades</hi> having heard the fortune of his <hi>Ephthalites,</hi> marcht apace toward the Enemy, and by the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the brook gueſt at the matter, and that the enemy was unprepared. So commanding to drive on with full ſpeed, ſuddainly he ſurpriſed them at dinner, and unarmed. The <hi>Romans</hi> not able to abide their charge, ran away without ſtriking ſtroak. Some were overtaken and ſlain, others fled to the Mountain there, and for fear leapt down the rocks, not one of them eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping. Bat <hi>Cabades</hi> fearing his enemies, the <hi>Hunnes,</hi> who now invaded his country, went home with his whole Army, and had a long war with them on the Northern borders thereof. In the mean time the other <hi>Roman</hi> army came, but did nothing, having no Commander in chief, and the Generals with their equality of power ever croſſing one anothers opinions. <hi>Celer</hi> paſt the river <hi>Nymphius,</hi> and invaded <hi>Arzaméne,</hi> (This river runs by <hi>Martyropolis,</hi> and is diſtant from <hi>Amida</hi> thirty five miles) and having forraged the country, ſoon went home. <hi>Areobindus,</hi> the Emperour ſent for to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſate down before <hi>Amida</hi> in the winter. Who failing in their endeavours to force the place, reſolved to take it by famine: And the beſieged then wanted proviſions; but the Generals not knowing it, and ſeeing the ſouldier weary of a winter ſiege; imagining alſo, the <hi>Perſian</hi> army would ere long come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, they made haſt in ſome way to riſe from thence.

The <hi>Romans</hi> being not yet ſet down before <hi>Amida,</hi> but not far from it, a peaſant who frequented the City, and uſed ſecretly to ſell to <hi>Glones</hi> at great rates, poultery, bread, and ripe fruits, promiſed the Generall <hi>Patricius</hi> for reward to put <hi>Glones</hi> and two hundred <hi>Perſians</hi> into his hands. He promiſed him his demand, and ſent him away. The man rent his garments, and came weeping into the town; went to <hi>Glones;</hi> and tearing his hair, <q>My Lord, quoth he, I was bringing you of my beſt proviſions; but I was met, beaten, and had all taken from me, by theſe rogues whoſe cuſtome it is to rob the poor peaſants (being old <hi>Roman</hi> ſouldiers) rambling in ſmall parties; and who fly before

                  <hi>Glones</hi> askt, how many would ſuffice for the buſineſs; He ſaid fifty was enough, being to meet not above five together; but whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhould happen, it would be good to have 100. and if it were 200. 'twere the better; Store hurts no man. <hi>Glones</hi> choſe 200. horſe, and bad the man guide them. But he ſaid, 'twas better, to ſend him before to diſcover theſe <hi>Roman</hi> free booters, and to bring the <hi>Perſians</hi> word, who then might take their beſt orportunity. <hi>Glones</hi> approved of his counſell; and then he went to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall <hi>Patricius,</hi> and acquainted him with all the proceedings, who ſent 1000. Souldiers, and two of his own Life-guard with him. Theſe he laid in ambuſh, neer a village called <hi>Thialaſamum,</hi> five miles from <hi>Amida,</hi> within a vally of coppices and buſhes. Then he ran, and told <hi>Glones,</hi> his game was ready, and guided him and his 200. men into the enemies ambuſh. Being paſt a good ſpace within it, unſeen by <hi>Glones</hi> or his Company, he ran and called up the <hi>Romans</hi> ambuſh, and ſhewed them the enemy. The <hi>Perſians</hi> ſeing them, were amazed at the ſuddain accident; Retire they could not (the enemy having their backs) nor being in an enemies Country knew any other way to runne. As they could therefore, they put in order to receave the aſſailants, but over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matcht in numbers were broken, and all killed with <hi>Glones,</hi> which vexed his Son, that he could not ſtay to revenge his Fathers death, ſo that he burnt the Church of St. <hi>Simeon,</hi> where he lodged. Other buildings neither <hi>Glones,</hi> nor <hi>Cabades,</hi> nor any <hi>Perſian,</hi> deſtroyed nor defaced in <hi>Amida,</hi> nor without it.</p>
               <p>But to returne to my former diſcourſe. Thus the <hi>Romans</hi> recovered <hi>Amida</hi> for mony, two yeares after the taking. Being within it, their own negligence appeared, and the <hi>Perſians</hi> abſtemiouſneſs, finding, by comparing the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the victuall left, and the <hi>Barbarians</hi> that went out, not above ſeven dayes proviſion remaining, though <hi>Glones</hi> &amp; his ſon had long iſſued it out to the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> more ſcarcely, then need could well endure; and to the <hi>Romans</hi> in the Town nothing, from the beginning of the ſiege; So that they were forced to eat unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall food, and abominable, and at laſt one another. The Generalls, finding themſelves thus deceaved by the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> reproached the Souldiers intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and diſobedience, who having it in their power to take the Town with all the <hi>Perſians</hi> in it at mercy, had diſhonorably tranſported the <hi>Roman</hi> treaſure to <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and gotten <hi>Amida,</hi> as a merchandize for mony.

But the Emperour (who uſed not to doe things unadviſedly) conſidering that it was not poſſible to maintaine a garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in that place, wanting all commodities, and having no nation neer it ſubject to the <hi>Romans,</hi> he thanckt the man much for his good will, but would not meddle with the thing. <hi>Ambazuces</hi> ſoone after died, and <hi>Cabades</hi> forcing out his ſonnes, poſſeſſed himſelfe of the Gates. <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> alſo, after the truce with <hi>Cabades,</hi> at a place called <hi>Daras,</hi> built a very ſtrong City, and named it then <hi>Anaſtaſia,</hi> being diſtant from <hi>Niſibis</hi> about twelve miles, and from the <hi>Perſian</hi> frontier three miles and a halfe at moſt.

Another City alſo this Emperor built upon the frontier of <hi>Perſarmema,</hi> which had been before a village, and from <hi>Theodoſius</hi> his name was called <hi>Theodoſia.</hi> But <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> compaſſed it with a ſtrong wall, which no leſſe then the other troubled the <hi>Perſians,</hi> being both as Rampires upon his Country.

                  <hi>Cabades</hi> was alſo troubled, fearing innovation upon his houſe after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe; For upon his Sonnes he could not transferre the Kingdom, without ſome queſtion. His eldeſt, <hi>Caoſes,</hi> the law invited, but him he could not abide; the fathers opinion therein overruling nature, and the ancient Lawes. His ſecond Sonne <hi>Zames,</hi> having loſt an eye, the Law excluded, prohibiting to make a King having but one eye, or any other maime. But <hi>Choſroes,</hi> borne of the ſiſter of <hi>Aſpevedes,</hi> he chiefly affected.

But for this I muſt demand a favour, which binding our ſelves, and ſubjects by kindred, and the conſequent thereof, good affection, may for ever ſettle to us the bleſſings of peace.

                  <hi>Juſtine</hi> was glad at the propoſition, and ſo was <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> his ſiſters ſon, and ſucceſſor deſigned, urging the ſpeedy perfection, and drawing up of the adoption after the <hi>Roman</hi> forme. But <hi>Proclus</hi> croſt it: who was aſſeſſor to the Emperor (the <hi>Romans</hi> call this officer, <hi>Quaeſtor</hi>) and a knowne juſt man, not to be bribed, nor haſtily paſſing Edicts, or altring things ſetled: He oppoſing it, ſpake thus. I uſe not <q>to meddle with novelties, which of all things I feare moſt knowing that they cannot poſſibly ſtand with ſafety. But were I a very daring man, I think I ſhould ſhrinck and tremble at the ſtorme that is to be expected from this Act. For I cannot conceave any thing now in conſulation, but with a faire pretence to betray our State to the <hi>Perſians;</hi> who in plaine words, without diſguiſing, or modeſlie, pray us to let them take our Empire from us; covering their groſſe deceipt with ſimplicity, and their impudent propoſition with a pretended deſire of quietneſſe. But you both had need to oppoſe this deſigne of the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians,</hi> to the utmoſt of your power; you Sir I leaſt you prove the laſt <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour; and you the General, leaſt you block up your own way to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.

By nature is due to children their fathers eſtates: All Lawes, though differing in other things, do yet in this agree, both among <hi>Romans,</hi> and <hi>Barbarians,</hi> that children are to inherit their fathers eſtates. So that yeilding to this their firſt requeſt, the reſt you muſt conſequently grant.</q> The Emperour and his Nephew approved this ſpeech, conſulting what was to be done. In the meane time came other letters from <hi>Cabades</hi> to <hi>Juſtine,</hi> to ſend to him men of experience, for conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a peace, and to ſignifie the forme that was to be obſerved in the adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Upon this <hi>Proclus</hi> more eagerly oppoſed the <hi>Perſians</hi> propoſall, and urged that they ſhould rather adopt to themſelves the <hi>Roman</hi> power and dominion; declaring his opinion, that it was fit they, as ſpeedily as might be, ſhould conclude a peace; and withall that ſome chief men ſhould be ſent; who being demanded by <hi>Cabades,</hi> in what manner the adoption ſhould be, ſhould anſwer, as is fit for a <hi>Barbarian;</hi> For the <hi>Barbarians</hi> adopt ſons, not by writings, but by arming them. Accordingly Ambaſſadors were ſent by <hi>Juſtine,</hi> and promiſe of ſome greater men to follow, for conſummating all touching the peace, and <hi>Choſroes.</hi> There were therefore ſhortly after ſent <hi>Hypatius</hi> a patrician, Nephew to the late Emperour <hi>Anaſtaſius,</hi> and Generall of the Eaſt; and <hi>Rufinus,</hi> ſonne of <hi>Silvanus,</hi> a principall patrician, and one well knowne to <hi>Cabades.</hi> From the <hi>Perſians</hi> came <hi>Seoſes,</hi> their moſt powerfull man, who had the chief power over all armies and offices; and with him <hi>Mebodes,</hi> who was Maſter of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace in <hi>Perſia.</hi> Theſe meeting upon the frontier, treated concerning an accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the differences, and concluding a peace. And <hi>Choſroes</hi> came down to the <hi>Tigris,</hi> two dayes journy from <hi>Niſibis,</hi> that the peace being concluded, he might go to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> Many diſcourſes paſt about their differences; and <hi>Seoſes</hi> alledged, that <hi>Colchis,</hi> now called <hi>Lazica,</hi> antiently belonged to the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and that the <hi>Romans</hi> held it from them unjuſtly. The <hi>Romans</hi> took it very ill that their title to <hi>Lazica</hi> ſhould be queſtioned; But when they ſaid, that the Adoption muſt be performed in a form fit for a <hi>Barbarian,</hi> the <hi>Perſians</hi> thought this inſufferable. So both broke off, and they ſeverally went home. And <hi>Choſroës</hi> returned to his father, vowing to revenge this ſcorn upon the <hi>Romans.</hi>

                  <hi>Mebodes</hi> afterward accuſed <hi>Seoſes</hi> for mentioning <hi>Lazica</hi> without their Maſter direction, purpoſely to break the Treaty, and for communicating therein firſt with <hi>Hypatius,</hi> who bare the King leaſt affection, and croſt the concluſion of the Peace, and the Adoption. <hi>Seoſes</hi> being charged by his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies with many other things, was called to a judiciall tryall before the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Senate, who were all diſpleaſed with his new Office, and offended at his behaviour. He was a man free from corruption, and very juſt; but extremely arrogant. Which, though a vice naturall to the great Officers of <hi>Perſia,</hi> yet in <hi>Seoſes,</hi> themſelves thought it to reign in extremity. His accuſers charged him with the matters afore mentioned; and for not contenting himſelf with the ancient cuſtomes of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> worſhipping new Gods; and that lately he had buryed his Wife; the <hi>Perſian</hi> Laws prohibiting the burying of dead bodies in the earth. So the Judges condemned him to dye. And <hi>Cabades</hi> ſeemed to grieve as for a friend, but would not pardon him; profeſſing that he was not offended with him, but he muſt not infringe the Laws: And yet he owed his life <hi>Seoſes,</hi> who was the chiefeſt cauſe of his living and reigning; and being thus condemned, he was put to death. His office as it began ſo it ended with him, none after him having ever the like Generall power over all offices and armies. <hi>Rufinus</hi> alſo accuſed <hi>Hypatius</hi> to the Emperour, who upon it diſcharged him of his Office; but after torturing ſome about him, he found no truth in the accuſation, and ſo did no other harm to him.</p>

The <hi>Perſians</hi> ſoon after came with their army, and encamped at <hi>Amodis,</hi> a Village two miles and a half from <hi>Daras,</hi> where were <hi>Pituazes</hi> and <hi>Bareſmanas</hi> with one eye, and other Commanders; the Generall of the whole Army being <hi>Perozes,</hi> by office a <hi>Mirranes,</hi> ſo called in <hi>Perſia,</hi> who ſent to command <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> to make ready the bath, for the next day he meant to bathe in <hi>Daras.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> upon this provided ſtrongly for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, as being the next day to fight.

All about the trench ſtood the reſt of the Horſe, and the Infantery; behind whom toward the middle, ſtood <hi>Beliſarius</hi> and <hi>Hermogenes.</hi> Thus were the <hi>Romans</hi> ordered, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting to 25000; the <hi>Perſian</hi> being 40000 Horſe and Foot. They ſtood both in rank (their Fronts againſt each other) ſtriving to make it as deep, as might be. Neither began the fight; but the <hi>Perſians</hi> ſeemed to wonder at the <hi>Romans</hi> order, muſing what they would doe. Towards evening ſome Horſe from their right wing charged the Troupes of <hi>Buzes</hi> and <hi>Pharas;</hi> who retreating fair and ſoftly, the <hi>Perſians</hi> did not purſue them, but ſtood ſtill; fearing to be compaſt by the Enemy. The retiring <hi>Romans</hi> then of a ſuddain charged them; who ſtaid it not, but gallopt home to the Batallion; and <hi>Buzes</hi> and <hi>Pharas</hi> put themſelves into the ſame place and order again. Seven <hi>Perſians</hi> in this encounter were ſlain, whoſe bodies the <hi>Romans</hi> carryed off.

None preſenting themſelves, <hi>Andrew,</hi> though prohibited by <hi>Hermogenes,</hi> ſtole into the field; and both with their Lances made a furious charge. Their Lances broke upon their Corſlets; and their horſes heads meeting, down they fell with their riders; both falling neer each other.

                  <hi>I ſhould be perſwaded by your letters to doe what you deſire, if it were not a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from Romans; who can eaſily promiſe, but their performance is not to be hoped; though you confirme your agreements with oath. So that tired with your deceipts, we are forced to come armed; and expect nothing, my deare</hi> Romans! <hi>now, but war with us.

                  <hi>ANd the next day,</hi> Mirranes <hi>about Sun riſing, calling his Souldiers, made a ſpeech to them; That he knew</hi> Perſians <hi>in dangers, not to take their courage from their Captains orations, but from their own vertue, and awe of one another. But ſeing them diſpute, how the</hi> Romans, <hi>not uſing without tumult and diſorder to come to fight, receaved the</hi> Perſians <hi>now with an order ſo little belonging to them: Leaſt upon a falſe conceipt they ſhould commit error, he warned them, not to ſuppoſe the</hi> Romans <hi>upon the ſuddaine grown more valiant, and expert Souldiers, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cowards more then ever; being ſo affraid of</hi> Perſians, <hi>that they dare not embat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle without making a trench to defend them; nor with it begin a fight, but are glad, and thinck their buſineſs ſpedd above their hopes, if they are able to retire to their walls, the</hi> Perſians <hi>not charging them: Hence were they in no diſorder, not coming to the hazard of a battell. But if the fight come to handy blows, then their cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize and want of experience will put them into their wonted diſorder. And for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves he bad them have their thoughts upon the judgement of their King of Kings, expecting a baſe puniſhment, if they doe not now fight as becomes the valour of</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians.</p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:50471:16"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mirranes</hi> having thus encouraged his Souldiers, led on againſt the enemy. Beliſarius <hi>alſo and</hi> Hermogenes, <hi>drawing out their troupes from their trench; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted them to conſider by the former fight, that the</hi> Perſians <hi>are not invincible, nor immortall; and that they were beaten by them formerly through their own diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to their commanders, not by any advantage of valour or ſtrong bodies in the enemy. Which fault they may eaſily amend. Indeed the croſſes of fortune no induſtry can cure, but of a mans faults; his own will may be the Phyſician. So that if they reſolve to obey directions; the day will be theirs: and the enemy failing in their one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confidence,</hi> (<hi>the</hi> Romans <hi>diſorder</hi>) <hi>will goe off, as they did in the former encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And for the enemies nombers (their greateſh ſcare-crow) he bad them deſpiſe it: Seing their foot was nothing els, but a multitude of miſerable peaſants, who come to the warre onely to ſappe a wall, or riffle a dead body, and other things to ſerve the Souldier: having no armes to trouble much an enemy; and their bucklers no big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then to ward a ſhot onely. So that if they fight bravely this day, they will both vanquiſh the</hi> Perſians <hi>now, and reſtraine their inſolence from invading the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> and <hi>Hermogenes</hi> having made this exhortation, and ſeing the <hi>Perſians</hi> coming on, ordred the Army, as before. The <hi>Perſians</hi> ſtood oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite in front; <hi>Mirranes,</hi> not placing ſo the whole Army, but the one halle one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the other ſhood behind him, to receave men from the fight, and to give on freſh, and ſo in their turnes to come all to fight. The band onely, named <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall,</hi> he commanded to ſtand ſtill, till himſelf gave the ſignall: Who ſtood in the front, giving the command of the right wing to <hi>Pityazes,</hi> and of the left to <hi>Bareſmanas.</hi> The Armies being thus embattell'd <hi>Charas</hi> came to <hi>Beliſarius</hi> and <q>
                     <hi>Hermogenes;</hi> and ſaid thus: I ſee no great ſervice I can doe upon the enemy, ſtaying here with my <hi>Herulians:</hi> But if covering our ſelves under yonder riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ground, when the fight is begun, we ſhall ſuddainly from the hillock charge, ſhooting the enemies backs, in likelyhood we ſhall ruine them.</q>

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarius</hi> approved it, and accordingly it was done. Neither ſide began the fight till noone, which being paſt, the <hi>Perſians</hi> gave on: Who put it off to that time of the day, becauſe themſelves uſe to eat about evening, and the <hi>Romans</hi> at noone; and if they charged them faſting, they thought they would not endure the fight ſo well. At firſt the arrowes ſlew from both ſides, and with their mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude made a kind of duskineſs a long time, and ſlew many. The <hi>Perſians</hi> arrowes came much thicker, by reaſon of their freſh men ſtill renewing, which the <hi>Romans</hi> did not marke: Who notwithſtanding had not the worſe, a ſtrong wind blowing upon the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and not ſuffering their ſhot to do much effect. The Arrowes being ſpent, they uſed their Lances, on both ſides, and came up cloſer. The <hi>Romans</hi> left wing was in moſt diſtreſs, where the <hi>Cadiſens,</hi> with <hi>Pityazes</hi> charging ſuddamely and furiouſly, routed them &amp; kill'd many in the execution.

And there the overthrow being cleer, the <hi>Romans</hi> on that ſide joining, made a great ſlaughter among the <hi>Barbarians;</hi> ſo that of their right wing they loſt about 3000.

Hence this river runs to the Country of <hi>Eceleſa,</hi> where was the Temple of <hi>Diana</hi> in <hi>Tauri; Iphigenia, Agamemnons</hi> daughter, with <hi>Oreſtes,</hi> and <hi>Pilades,</hi> flying thither with the image of <hi>Diana.</hi> The other Temple ſtanding to this day at <hi>Comana,</hi> is not that of <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri.</hi> But thus it was. <hi>Oreſtes</hi> ſtealing with his ſiſter from <hi>Tauri,</hi> fell into a great ſickneſs; and enquiring of the Oracle for cure, was anſwered, that he ſhould have no help, till he had built a Temple to <hi>Diana,</hi> like that in <hi>Tauri,</hi> and there ſhould ſhave off his haire, and call the City by it. <hi>Oreſtes</hi> hereupon tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling in theſe parts, ſaw the river <hi>Iris,</hi> ſpringing from a ſteep Mountaine, and ſuppoſing it to be the place deſigned by the Oracle, built there a faire Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and a Temple to <hi>Diana,</hi> and ſhaving his haire, called it <hi>Comana,</hi> which continues to this day. But this abated not the diſeaſe, which raged rather more. So that travelling, and ſeeking yet further, he found a place in <hi>Cappa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docia,</hi> very like <hi>Tauri,</hi> and I have wondred ſeing it, taking it for <hi>Tauri</hi> it ſelf. The Mountaine there is abſolutely like <hi>Taurus,</hi> and ſo called alſo, and the river <hi>Sarus</hi> there very like the river <hi>Euphrates.</hi> So there <hi>Oreſtes</hi> built a goodly City, with two Temples in it, the one to <hi>Diana,</hi> the other to his ſiſter <hi>Iphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genid,</hi> which the Chriſtians have made Churches, not altring the buildings at all. This City is called the <hi>Golden Comana,</hi> where he cut off his haire, and recovered of his diſeaſe. Which ſome hold to be no other, but the madneſs he fell into, for killing his own Mother. But the <hi>Euphrates</hi> from this <hi>Tauri</hi> in <hi>Eceleſa</hi> of <hi>Armenia,</hi> runs Southward by much Country, and takes in many rivers, and among the reſt <hi>Arſinus,</hi> (which comes down from <hi>Perſarmenia</hi>) then grown large, paſſes into <hi>Leucoſyria,</hi> now called the leſſer <hi>Armenia,</hi> the <hi>Metropolis</hi> whereof is <hi>Melitene,</hi> a faire City. From thence it runs by <hi>Samoſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> and <hi>Hierapolis,</hi> and many other townes, to <hi>Aſſyria;</hi> where both rivers meeting, end in one name of <hi>Tigris.</hi> The Country from <hi>Samoſata</hi> beyond the river was anciently called <hi>Comagena,</hi> but now <hi>Euphrateſia</hi> from the river. The Country on this ſide, between it and the <hi>Tigris,</hi> is called <hi>Meſopotamia:</hi> Some part of which hath ſeverall other names, as <hi>Armenia,</hi> unto <hi>Amida: Edeſſa</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, with the towns about it: And <hi>Oſrhoêne,</hi> from <hi>Oſrhoês,</hi> who anciently raign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there, when they were confederates of the <hi>Perſians.</hi> The <hi>Perſians</hi> therefore
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50471:18"/>having taken <hi>Niſibis,</hi> and other places in <hi>Meſopotamia</hi> from the <hi>Romans,</hi> when they invaded their country, ever neglected the Province beyond the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> being without water and waſt, and there drew together, being their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, &amp; near an enemies inhabited, &amp; from thence uſed to make their invaſions.</p>

                  <hi>MIrranes</hi> alſo upon his return with his Army overthrown, having loſt moſt of his men, had a ſharp puniſhment from the King, who took from him his Head-tire of gold and pearl, which tied up his hair; a mark of the greateſt honour in <hi>Perſia,</hi> next to the King: where none may wear gold, ring, nor belt, nor buckle, nor any thing of gold, but by the Kings grant. <hi>Cabades</hi> then being in doubt how to invade the <hi>Romans;</hi> for <hi>Mirranes</hi> failing thus, he could not preſume upon any other; <hi>Alamundarus,</hi> King of the <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens,</hi> adviſed him thus, <q>In all things not to truſt to Fortune, nor in all wars to expect the better; being neither reaſonable, nor mans condition; but the conceit of it prejudicial. For mens unreaſonable hopes of ſucceſs, failing ſometimes, (as they may) prove their vexation. That men having not ever Fortune to preſume on, put not war bluntly upon hazards, though they have the advantage of their enemies, but ſtudy to deceive them with ſtratagemes. In a danger upon equal terms is no aſſurance of victory. That therefore he ſhould not grieve for the misfortunes of <hi>Mirranes,</hi> nor tempt Fortune again. If he enter by <hi>Meſopotamia</hi> and <hi>Oſroëne,</hi> where the Cities were never ſtronger, nor better guarded with ſouldiers, that he will have no ſure bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain of it. That the Country beyond the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and <hi>Syria</hi> next it, hath no fortified City, nor conſiderable Forces; but he ſhall find <hi>Antioch</hi> the chief <hi>Roman</hi> City of the Eaſt for wealth, bignes, and populouſnes, with no ſouldiers in it; and a common people thinking upon nothing but Holy-daies, and Feaſts, their perpetual quarrels with one another in the Theaters. Which he may take by ſurpriſe, and return home, without meeting an Enemy, and before the Forces of <hi>Meſopotamia</hi> can have the news of him. That he ſhould take no thought about water, or proviſions: himſelf would guide the Army the beſt way.</q> 
                  <hi>Cabades</hi> neither diſputed againſt this adviſe, nor diſtruſted it; knowing <hi>Alamundarus</hi> a wiſeman, an experienced ſouldier, and faithfull to the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and very valiant; who for fifty years, had brought the <hi>Romans</hi> into low caſe, from <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Meſopotamia</hi> forraging their country, and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all afore him, burning cities, and making innumerable ſlaves, whom he kill'd, or ſold for a great deal of money. He made his inroads ſo ſuddainly, and advantageouſly, that none encountred him: The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders ſeldome hearing of him, before he was gone with his booty. And when any overtook him, he defeated them, either charging them unprepared, or purſuing diſorderly. Once he took priſoners <hi>Demoſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> brother of <hi>Rufinus,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Lucas,</hi> with all their men, and got a great ſum of money for their ranſom. In a word, he was the ſharpeſt enemy the <hi>Romans</hi> had. The reaſon was, becauſe onely <hi>Alamundarus</hi> had command of the <hi>Saracens</hi> under the <hi>Perſians,</hi> with authority and title of a King; whereby he could invade the <hi>Romans</hi> when and where he pleaſed. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were the <hi>Roman</hi> Captains, called <hi>Duces Limitanei,</hi> nor the <hi>Phylarchi,</hi> or chieftains of the <hi>Saracen</hi>-tribes in league with the <hi>Romans,</hi> able to oppoſe him, being too weak to fight with him ſingle in their ſeverall countries. Whereupon the Emperour <hi>Juſtinian</hi> put many of thoſe Tribes under <hi>Arethas,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Gabâlas,</hi> chieftain of the <hi>Saracens</hi> in <hi>Arabia,</hi> giving him the title of a King; a thing not uſed by the <hi>Romans.</hi> But <hi>Alamundarus</hi> rather more ruined the <hi>Romans; Arethas</hi> in the inroads or fights, either ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ill fortune, or betraying the buſineſs; we have no certainty of him. And ſo <hi>Alamundarus</hi> (none oppoſing) forraged the Eaſt furtheſt of any, and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, being a very old man; and <hi>Cabades</hi> liking his counſell, ſent 15000 men under the command of <hi>Azarethes</hi> (as I have ſaid) whom <hi>Alamundarus</hi> was to guide the way.</p>

               <p>THeſe paſſing the <hi>Euphrates</hi> into <hi>Comagena</hi> unlookt for, and being the firſt <hi>Perſians</hi> that ever invaded us that way, that we can learn, it amazed the <hi>Romans,</hi> and at firſt perplexed <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> when he heard it. But he ſoon reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon reſiſtance, and having left competent garriſons in the places, of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopotamia,</hi> that <hi>Cabades</hi> with the reſt of his army might not find them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded; he went with ſpeed againſt the Enemy, compaſſing the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and having about 20000 horſe and foot, 2000 of them <hi>Iſaurians.</hi> The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of horſe were the ſame that fought at <hi>Daras</hi> with <hi>Mirranes.</hi> Of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantery was <hi>Peter</hi> commander, a Lancier of the guard to <hi>Juſtinian;</hi> and of the <hi>Iſaurians, Longinus</hi> and <hi>Stephanacius.</hi> At the City of <hi>Colchis</hi> they encamped, hearing the Enemy were at <hi>Gabbula,</hi> a place almoſt fourteen miles from it. <hi>Alamundarus,</hi> and <hi>Azarethes</hi> hearing thereof, ſtayd their journey, reſolving to march homeward, fearing to hazard; and they retired, keeping the <hi>Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> to their left hand. The <hi>Roman</hi> army followed; and where the Enemy lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, ſate down the night after: <hi>Beliſarius</hi> purpoſely not ſuffering the Army to march greater journeys, having no mind to fight, and thinking it ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent if <hi>Alamundarus</hi> and the <hi>Perſians</hi> retired home without effect. The army at this murmured at him, both Commanders and Souldiers, but not yet to his face. The <hi>Perſians</hi> at laſt lodged upon the ſhore of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> oppoſite to the City of <hi>Callinicum,</hi> reſolving from thence to march through a deſert country, and ſo out of <hi>Roman</hi> ground, and not as before by the rivers ſide. The <hi>Romans</hi> from the City <hi>Sura,</hi> where they lodg'd, roſe, and overtook the Enemy truſſing up their baggage. The Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter</hi> was to be the next day, which Chriſtians obſerve above all others; the day before it, and much of the night abſtaining from all meats and drinks. And <hi>Beliſarius</hi> ſeeing them eager upon the enemy, and willing to withdraw them from the opinion, (<hi>Hermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> being of the ſame mind, ſent newly <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> from the <hi>Emperour</hi>) he called them together, and ſpake thus; <q>Whether are you tranſported fellow ſouldiers! to chuſe thus a needleſs danger? That onely is pure victory, that comes off without damage from the Enemy: and that now fortune, and the fear of us amazing them, gives us; which advantage it is better to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, having it, than to ſeek it when it is gone. The <hi>Perſians</hi> invited with hopes, invaded us, and now failing, run away. If we force them to change their courſe, and fight; overcoming, we gain nothing, but to rout an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my flying already. But having the worſt, we loſe our preſent victory (not forced from it, but giving it away) and leave the <hi>Emperours</hi> land to the ſpoil of the Enemy, with none to defend it. Conſider alſo, that God doth co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate with mens neceſſary, not wilfull actions; how men ſtopt from fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will fight, though unwillingly; and how many diſadvantages there are to us for a battell, many being marcht hither afoot, and all of us faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſome of us not yet come up:</q> The Army reproached <hi>Beliſarius</hi> for this ſpeech, not muttering now, but with open clamour to his face, calling him faint-hearted man, and a diſcourager of them. And this errour ſome Commanders ran into with the ſouldier, onely to ſhew their valour. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſarius</hi> amazed at this impudence, turned his diſcourſe to encourage them, and to order them to the encounter, ſaying that he knew not their alacrity before, but now he took courage, and went againſt the enemy with more hopes. So he ſet his Batallion in front, and his foot in the left wing towards the river, and to the right hand, where there was a ſteep peece of ground, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rethas</hi> with his <hi>Saracens:</hi> himſelf with the horſe ſtood in the middle. <hi>Aza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rethes</hi> ſeeing the <hi>Romans</hi> embattell'd, and ready for the encounter, ſaid to his men; <q>That being <hi>Perſians,</hi> certainly they will never change their honour for life, if they might have the choice. But that now, if they would, they could make no ſuch choice. They who can by running from a danger, live diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, if they can ſo reſolve, chuſe yet inſtead of the beſt, the moſt pleaſant thing. But they who muſt die either honourably by an enemy, or baſely by
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50471:19"/>a ſuperiour, dradg'd to execution, are mad if they chuſe not the beſt condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, inſtead of the baſeſt. He bad them therefore, not thinking onely upon the enemy, but upon their Lord and Maſter, ſo to fight that day.</q> Having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted them, he placed his Batallion oppoſite to the Enemy, and gave the right wing to the <hi>Perſians.</hi> and the leſt to the <hi>Saracens.</hi> The battell then joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and was ſtifly fought. The arrows flew thick from both ſides, and killed many. Some ſingle encounters were between the Battallions, with much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour performed. The <hi>Perſians</hi> fell more by the ſhot, though they ſhot thicker, and are almoſt all Archers, and the moſt dextrous living; but from weak bowes little beut, the ſhaft lighting upon the <hi>Romans</hi> corſlet, head-peece, or ſheild, crackt without hurt doing. The <hi>Romans</hi> ſhot is ſlower, being from ſtiff bowes much bent, and hardly; but coming from ſtronger men than <hi>Perſians,</hi> they ſpeed where they light, no armour reſiſting the force. Two thirds of the day were paſt, and the fight yet equall. When the <hi>Perſians</hi> beſt men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bining, charged the right wing, where was <hi>Arethas</hi> and his <hi>Saracens.</hi> They opened their Battallion, and not abiding the charge ranne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, ſuſpected that day to betray the <hi>Romans.</hi> The <hi>Perſians</hi> thus breaking through the ranks, had the backs of the <hi>Romans</hi> horſe, who weary with their journey and toyl in fight, being faſting too, and preſt both wayes by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, gave it over, and ran into ſmall Ilands in the river near them. Some ſtaid and did bravely; among whom <hi>Aſcas,</hi> having ſlain many chief <hi>Perſians,</hi> was with much adoe cut in pieces, leaving a noble ſtory to his enemies; and with him eight hundred more fell, good men; and all the <hi>Iſaurians,</hi> with their Commanders, uſing no reſiſtance: Men unexperienced, newly taken from the plough, and who knew not what a battell meant; yet hotter than any upon the fight, they reproached <hi>Beliſarius</hi> with cowardize a little before. Indeed they were not all <hi>Iſaurians,</hi> but moſt <hi>Lycaonians. Beliſarius</hi> ſtaying with ſome few, while <hi>Aſcas</hi> and his company ſtood, reſiſted alſo: But ſeeing them ſlain, he fled into the battallion of foot, where <hi>Peter</hi> their leader maintained the fight, with ſome with him, the moſt being run away. Then <hi>Beliſarius</hi> quitted his horſe, cauſing his followers to doe the like, and with the reſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the enemy. Who after a ſhort execution came back, and gave on upon <hi>Beliſarius;</hi> who to prevent the enemies compaſs, kept his mens backs to the river, and ſtood their charge; where was a fierce fight, though with unequall powers, a few footmen fighting with all the <hi>Perſian</hi> horſe, and yet not routed by them. For ſtanding cloſe, and fencing with their ſhields, they ſhot the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to more purpoſe, than they were ſhot. And the <hi>Barbarians</hi> to break them, riding oft againſt them, rode back again without effect; their horſes being skittiſh upon the claſhing of the ſhields, and the riders in confuſion. And at night they retired to their camp. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> alſo with ſome few got into a ſhip, and paſt into an Iland, whether ſome came after ſwimming. The next day the <hi>Romans</hi> were tranſported to <hi>Callinicum</hi> in ſhips, ſent from thence. The <hi>Perſians</hi> having ſpoyled the dead bodies, went home; finding their own not fewer in number than their enemies. <hi>Azarethes</hi> at his come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home had no thanks from <hi>Cabades,</hi> though he wanne this battell; and upon this reaſon. When an Army is levyed in <hi>Perſia</hi> the King uſes to ſit upon his Throne, and by him ſtand baskets, and the General deſigned for the army; which is to paſs man by man before the King, and each to throw an arrow into the baskets; and they to be ſealed with the Kings own ſeal. When the army comes home, every ſouldier takes his arrow out of the panniers, and ſome Commiſſioners number the arrows remaining, and ſo report to the King the number of the ſouldiers come home; whereby it is known how many are periſhed in that war. This cuſtom is ancient in <hi>Perſia;</hi> and <hi>Azarethes</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting himſelf to the King, he askt him what place he had conquered, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving invaded the <hi>Romans</hi> with <hi>Alamundarus,</hi> with deſign to take <hi>Antioch? Azarethes</hi> anſwered, that he had taken no place, but had vanquiſht <hi>Belliſarius</hi> in battell. Then <hi>Cabades</hi> willed the army to come in, and take out their arrows, whereof many being left in the baskets, the King reviled <hi>Azarethes,</hi> and after hold him in diſgrace.</p>

The <hi>Homerites</hi> are to the Eaſt of <hi>Paleſtina,</hi> upon the red ſea, which beginning from <hi>India,</hi> ends in that part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; having upon the coaſt where it ends, in a narrow ſtraight, the City <hi>AElas,</hi> and the mountains of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> to the South, and a deſart country, reaching far to the North. As you ſayl in, the land from both fides is ſeen, till the Iland of <hi>Jotabeé,</hi> which is from <hi>Aelas</hi> ſome hundred and five and twenty miles; where are ſeated the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> anciently free, but in <hi>Juſtinians</hi> reign made ſubject to the <hi>Romans.</hi> From hence a large ſea opening, no land is to be ſeen to the right hand, as you ſayl in, but at night you caſt anchor on the left hand ſhore, the ſea being full of ſhelfes, and in the dark not to be meddled with. There are many harbours made by the nature of the places, and ſafe to put in at. The coaſt from <hi>Paleſtina</hi> the <hi>Saracens</hi> poſſeſe, who are anciently ſeated in the country of Palm-trees, being in the midland, ſpacious, and having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing growing but Date-trees. Which <hi>Abocharabus,</hi> Governour of the <hi>Saracens</hi> there, gave to <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> who made him Chieftain of the <hi>Saracens</hi> in <hi>Paleſtina,</hi> thereby preſerving that Province from ſpoyl, <hi>Abocharabus</hi> being terrible to his ſubjects and enemies; and very valiant. This country of Palm-trees being deſert, and in the middle without water, for ten dayes journey, is of no uſe to us. <hi>Abocharabus</hi> gave us the name of a preſent only, which the Emperour knowing well, yet took it of him. Next to the <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens</hi> in <hi>Paleſtina,</hi> are other upon the ſame coaſt, called <hi>Maadeni,</hi> ſubject to the <hi>Homerites.</hi> Upon the coaſt nextbeyond are the <hi>Homerites,</hi> and beyond them many other nations are ſeated, to the Man-eating <hi>Saracens.</hi> Beyond whom are the <hi>Indians.</hi> Oppoſite to the <hi>Homerites</hi> on the other ſhore are <hi>Ethiopians;</hi> called <hi>Auxomites,</hi> of the City of <hi>Auxomis,</hi> where is their Kings court. The ſea between them is five dayes and nights ſayl over, with a reaſonable wind, keeping there the ſea all night, by reaſon there are no ſlielves. This ſome call the <hi>Red ſea;</hi> and the reſt as you ſail out to <hi>AElas,</hi> the <hi>Arabian gulf.</hi> For all the country from thence to <hi>Gaza</hi> was formerly called <hi>Arabia,</hi> and their King held his Court at <hi>Petra.</hi> The <hi>Homerites</hi> haven from whence they ſayl into <hi>Ethiopia</hi> is called <hi>Boulicas,</hi> and they land at a haven of the <hi>Adulites,</hi> from whence, the City of <hi>Adulis</hi> is onely two miles and a half, and from <hi>Auxomis</hi> twelve dayes journey. The vaſſels of <hi>India,</hi> and on theſe ſeas, are not built like other ſhips, nor trimmed with pitch or ſuch like, nor are the planks faſtned with iron through them, but tyed together with cords. Not becauſe of Iron-drawing Rocks (as is vulgarly thought) the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhips upon that ſea coming from <hi>AElas,</hi> though built with Iron, finding no ſuch matter; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe neither <hi>Indians,</hi> nor <hi>Ethiopians</hi> have. Iron, nor other materials for that uſe: Nor can they buy any of the <hi>Romans;</hi> who forbid it upon pain of death. From <hi>Auxomis</hi> aforeſaid, to the <hi>Roman</hi> Frontiers in <hi>Egypt,</hi> is thirty dayes journey; where are the <hi>Blemmyes,</hi> and <hi>Nobates,</hi> and other numerous people. The <hi>Blemmyes</hi> are ſeated in the midland, but the <hi>Nobates</hi> upon the <hi>Nile.</hi> This was not formerly the <hi>Roman</hi> frontier, which was ſeven dayes journey beyond. But <hi>Diocleſian</hi> finding their tribute a trifle, and their country nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, being moſt taken up with the rocks of <hi>Nile;</hi> and the garriſons in it (being many) burdening his Treaſury with the charge: And conſidering how theſe <hi>Nobates</hi> then dwelling about the City of <hi>Oäſis,</hi> ſpoyled the Towns near them, he drew them to riſe from that place, that they might no more trouble the country about <hi>Oäſts,</hi> by giving them fair <hi>Roman</hi> Cities, and a large country, all from <hi>Elephantina</hi> on both ſides the <hi>Nile,</hi> which he thought they would now guard, and beat off the <hi>Blemmyes</hi> (as being their own land) and other <hi>barbarous</hi> Nations. He gave them alſo, and to the <hi>Blemmyes,</hi> a penſion in Gold, not to prey upon the <hi>Roman</hi> territories; which they ſtill receive, yet over-run the Provinces. So impoſſible it is for <hi>Barbarians</hi> to keep,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50471:20"/>faith with <hi>Romans,</hi> but for feare of the Souldier. Yet the ſaid <hi>Emperour,</hi> in an Iland of the <hi>Nile</hi> neer <hi>Elephantina,</hi> built a ſtrong Caſtle, with Temples, and Altars for the <hi>Romans,</hi> and theſe people; appointing Prieſts of each Nation, and thinking by a participation in the ſame devotions, to make a ſure amity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. And upon this he called the place <hi>Philae,</hi> Both the <hi>Blemmyes,</hi> and the <hi>Nobates</hi> worſhip the Gods eſteemed by the <hi>Graecians,</hi> and <hi>Iſis</hi> and <hi>Oſiris</hi> and <hi>Priapus</hi> too; and the <hi>Blemmyes</hi> ſacrifice men to the <hi>Sunne.</hi> The Temples in <hi>Philae</hi> theſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> held to my time, but by direction of the <hi>Emperour Juſtinian, Narſes</hi> the <hi>Perſarmenian,</hi> who revolted to the <hi>Romans,</hi> (as I ſaid) commanding the forces in thoſe parts, demoliſhed them, keeping the Prieſts in reſtraint, and ſending the Images to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>

In the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Army were many, both ſlaves and leud perſons, that would not follow the King home, but ſtaid with the <hi>Homerites,</hi> being in love with the Country, as being very good land. But not long after, the people impriſoned <hi>Eſimiphaeus,</hi> and made one <hi>Abramus</hi> their King, a Chriſtian, who had been a ſlave to a <hi>Roman</hi> Merchant, reſiding for his traffique, in the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> City of <hi>Adulis. Helliſthaus,</hi> to puniſh <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> and his complices, for the wrong done to <hi>Eſimiphaeus,</hi> ſent againſt them under the command of a kinſman, 3000. men. Theſe alſo deſiring to remaine in that good land, liad ſecret conference with <hi>Abramus,</hi> unknown to their Commander, and in the battell kill'd him, and joyned with the enemies, and continued there. <hi>Helliſthaeus</hi> angry, ſent another Army, which coming to a battell returned with much loſſe; and then afraid to meddle any more with <hi>Abramus,</hi> he forbare warr. But he being dead, <hi>Abramus</hi> was content to pay the tribute to his ſucceſſour, and ſo confirmed his governement.</p>
               <p>Theſe things happened afterward. But then during the raignes of <hi>Helliſthae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and <hi>Eſimiphaeus, Juſtinian</hi> ſent his Ambaſſadour <hi>Julian,</hi> to deſire their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacie againſt the <hi>Perſians</hi> (the <hi>Romans,</hi> and they conſenting in one religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) and that the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> would make themſelves maſters of a rich trade, by dealing with the <hi>Indians</hi> for their ſilke, and ſelling it to the <hi>Romans,</hi> who ſhould have this onely advantage therein, that they ſhould carry out their mony to their enemies for it. Of this ſilke are made the anciently called <hi>Perſian,</hi> now <hi>Serick,</hi> or ſilke garments. The <hi>Homerites</hi> were prayed alſo to make chiefetaine of the <hi>Maadeni Saracens,</hi> one <hi>Caiſus,</hi> a baniſht man (who having kill'd a kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Eſimiphaeus,</hi> was fled into a wilderneſs, being of the race of the <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larchi,</hi> and a very good Souldier) and that together with thoſe <hi>Saracens,</hi> they would invade the <hi>Perſians.</hi> Both dimiſt the Ambaſſador with promiſe to effect the Emperours deſires, but neither performed; the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> not being able to buy the ſilke; becauſe the <hi>Perſian</hi> Merchants ever come firſt to the havens, where the <hi>Indians</hi> unlade, being their next borderers, and buy up all. And the <hi>Homerites</hi> thought it hard, to travell through a deſert, many dayes journy, to fight with a people more warlike then themſelves. Afterward <hi>Abramus</hi> having ſetled his Kingdome, promiſed oft to <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> but onely once began the journey, and turned home againe. Thus the <hi>Romans</hi> ſpedd with theſe people.</p>
               <p>In the meane time <hi>Hermogenes</hi> came to <hi>Cabades</hi> in Ambaſſage after the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> but could not effect the peace, finding him much enraged, and ſo came away. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> alſo the Emperour ſent for, diſcharging him of that command, to make warre upon the <hi>Vandales;</hi> and <hi>Sittas</hi> was ſent to guard
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50471:20"/>the Eaſt. The <hi>Perſian</hi> Army, led by <hi>Chanaranges, Aſpevedes</hi> and <hi>Mermeroes,</hi> againe entred <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> and (none encountring them) ſate downe before <hi>Martyropolis,</hi> where were garriſon'd <hi>Buzes,</hi> and <hi>Beſſas;</hi> It ſtands in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Sophanene,</hi> thirty miles to the North of <hi>Amida,</hi> upon the river of <hi>Nymphius,</hi> which bounds the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Perſian</hi> territories. The <hi>Perſians</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted, and were valiantly receaved by the beſieged, who could not thinke long to hold out, the walls being very aſſaultable, and eaſie for the <hi>Perſians</hi> works, and they having neither proviſions, nor engines, nor any other thing within of importance to defend. <hi>Sittas</hi> with the <hi>Roman</hi> army came to <hi>Attachas,</hi> twelve miles from <hi>Martyropolis;</hi> where he encamped, not daring to march further: with him was <hi>Hermogenes</hi> in another Ambaſſage. In the meane time this happened. The <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> have anciently had ſpies, defrayed at the publique charge, who ſecretly paſſe among the enemy; informing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of all occurrences, and advertiſing their owne Princes. Many of theſe, as affectionate Patriots, doe their beſt, ſome betray their Countries ſecrets to the enemy. One of the <hi>Perſian</hi> ſpies then diſcovered to <hi>Juſtinian</hi> much of their affaires, and how a Nation of <hi>Maſſagetes</hi> was coming into <hi>Perſia,</hi> and from thence were to invade the <hi>Romans,</hi> with the <hi>Perſian</hi> army. The Emperour had experience of the mans truth, and perſuades him with mony, to goe and report to the <hi>Perſians</hi> before <hi>Martyropolis,</hi> that theſe <hi>Maſſagetes</hi> were hired by the Emperour, and inſtantly to come againſt them. Who according went to the <hi>Perſian</hi> Camp, and told them that an armie of <hi>Hunnes</hi> their enemies were coming to ayde the <hi>Romans:</hi> which made them afraid, and doubtfull what to doe.</p>

               <p>THe peace being thus ratified by both parts, two Rebells of their owne ſubjects fell upon both theſe Emperours, in this manner. <hi>Choſroes</hi> was of an unruly ſpirit, a great undertaker, troubleſome; full of tumult himſelfe, and an extreame troubler of others. So that the <hi>Perſians</hi> being weary of his governement, ſuch of them, as were ſtirrers, conſulted to make another King of the houſe of <hi>Cabades. Zames</hi> they had a mind to, but the Law excluded him, for his mayme of an eye: In the end they reſolved to advance to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome the ſon of <hi>Zames;</hi> and he, as his ſons protector, to manage the affaires. This reſolution they revealed to <hi>Zames,</hi> and with their many encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, perſwaded him to the buſineſs; and a fit time was appointed to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize the King. But the plot being diſcovered to the King, he prevented it, and put <hi>Zames</hi> to death, and the reſt of his brother, and their male iſſue, and all ſuch men of quality, as contrived, or were acceſſory to the conſpiracy; among whom was <hi>Aſpevedes,</hi> his mothers brother. <hi>Cabades,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Zames,</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foſtered with the Generall <hi>Adergudunbades</hi>) he directed the ſaid Generall to kill, (though his own foſter child) truſting the man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> neither indeed could he force him, not without him kill the child. The Generall much grieved at
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50471:21"/>this diſmall Injunction, acquainted his wife with it, and the childs nurſe. The wife weeping, took him by the knees, and beſought him not to kill <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bades.</hi> So they conſulted together, and concluded to breed the child cloſely, and to write to <hi>Choſroes,</hi> that he was dead. This they did accordingly, and ſo concealed the young <hi>Cabades,</hi> that none had any ſuſpition, but his own ſon <hi>Varames,</hi> and one of his truſtieſt ſervants. But <hi>Cabades</hi> being come of age, the Generall fearing diſcovery, gave him money, and bad him ſave his life in ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. And all this he kept from the knowledge of <hi>Choſroes:</hi> till <hi>Choſroes</hi> went with his army into <hi>Lazica</hi> (as ſhall be related hereafter) and <hi>Varames</hi> with him, who had waiting on him the ſervant privy to the buſineſs of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bades,</hi> and revealed all to the King, producing his ſervant who agreed in all points. <hi>Choſroes</hi> raged, and thought it unſufferable, to beare ſuch things from one of his own ſlaves; and he bethought himſelfe of this way to get the man into his hands. When he was coming home out of <hi>Lazica</hi> he wrote to the Generall, that he reſolved to invade the <hi>Romans,</hi> and not at one entry, but dividing his army, that he might make his invaſion both on this ſide, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the <hi>Euphrates.</hi> One part himſelfe muſt lead, and he would upon no ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant beſtow an equality in honour with himſelf, but on him the Generall, in regard of his valour. So that he ſhould doe well, with ſpeed to meet him in his journey, that he might communicate, and direct what ſhould concern the expedition, leaving his traine to follow fair and foftly after. The Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall overjoyed with this honour from the King, and farr from gueſſing his own miſchief, did as he was commanded. But ſpent with hard travell, (being an old man) he ſlipt his bridle, and fell from his Horſe; wherewith his legg being broken, he was forced to ſtay to be cured. <hi>Choſroes</hi> arriving at the ſame place, he was brought to the Kings preſence; who told him he could not go the expedition appointed, with his legg in that caſe; but bad him at ſome Caſtle there get the help of Surgeons. And ſo he ſent him the way to his death, and after him men to kill him; An invincible Generall, and ſo reputed by the <hi>Perſians;</hi> having ſubdued twelve Nations to <hi>Cabades.</hi> Being dead, his ſon <hi>Varames</hi> was made Generall. Long afterward <hi>Cabades</hi> the ſon of <hi>Zames,</hi> or one uſurping his name, came to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> He was in his face like King <hi>Cabades,</hi> and <hi>Juſtinian</hi> uſed him honourably, as the grandchild of that King. <hi>Mebodes</hi> alſo <hi>Choſroes</hi> killed upon this ground. Being upon earneſt bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, he bad <hi>Zaberganes</hi> call <hi>Mebodes</hi> to him: who found him training his Souldiers, and told him, the King called him in haſt. He ſaid, he would come preſently, when he had diſpatcht the buſineſſe he was about. The other hating him, reported to the King, that <hi>Mebodes</hi> would not come as yet, alledging buſineſs. The King enraged, ſent one to him, to command him to the <hi>Tripos,</hi> or three-footed table. Which is thus. An iron three footed table ſtands ever at the Court-gate, and when any <hi>Perſian</hi> underſtands the King to be offended with him, he may not fly to Temple, or elſewhere; but ſitting by this table muſt expect the Kings ſentence, none being to guard him. Here <hi>Mebodes</hi> ſate many dayes in a pittifull habit, till one by the command of <hi>Choſroes,</hi> took him away, and killed him. To this came the good ſervices he had done <hi>Choſroes.</hi>

They fearing what came to paſſe, that the people would force them to the Empire, ſaid, that it was not honeſt to leave their Emperour in ſo great danger. <hi>Juſtinian</hi> at this was more ſuſpitious, and bad them inſtantly be gone home. They went, and it being night, were quiet; but the Sun no ſooner up, but it was divulged, how theſe Lords were retired from the palace: and all the multitude ran to them, and ſalute<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Hypatius</hi> Emperour, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted him to the market place, to take the affaires upon him; <hi>Maria</hi> his wife, a wiſe and ſober Matrone, crying, and lamenting, and proteſting to her friends, that the people were leading her husband to his death; and hanging upon him to ſtay him, till the people forced him from her. And when he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly come to <hi>Conſtantines</hi> market-place, they proclaimed him Emperour
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50471:22"/>of the <hi>Romans,</hi> binding about his head a golden wreath, for Diademe they had none, nor other thing uſuall to inveſt the Emperour. The Senators, as many as were not in the Palace, joyned; and the opinions of many were, to try their fortune at the Palace. But <hi>Origen</hi> a Senator admoniſhed them; <hi>That indeed the caſe they were in, could not be decided without warr, and that warr and Empire are confeſt the greateſt things among men. But great actions are not managed in an inſtant, but with adviſes and labours, which muſt have longer time for their exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. That if they march now to the Enemy, their affaires will be upon the edge of a razour; and in a little plece of time they ſhall adventure all, and then for what happens, either adore or revile Fortune; into whoſe hands the haſtieſt buſineſſes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly fall. But that if they carry it leyſurely, they ſhall not take</hi> Juſtinian <hi>in the Palace, if they would; who will thinck it well, if he may run away. Soveraignty deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed, totters downeward, the ſtrength of it daily conſuming: That there are other Palaces,</hi> Placillianae, <hi>and that of</hi> Helena, <hi>from whence this Emperour may iſſue, and manage the warr, and other matters.</hi> The multitude embraced this advice, and <hi>Hypatius,</hi> (who was to have a miſchief) bad them lead on to the <hi>Circus.</hi> Some ſay he went thither purpoſely, being well affected to the Emperour: Who held a Counſell, whether he ſhould ſtay, or fly by Sea: Many diſcourſes were; but the Empreſs <hi>Theodora</hi> ſpake thus. <hi>I ſuppoſe this no time to enquire, whether a woman ſhould be bold among men, or may be valiant, when they are afraid. They, whoſe affaires are come into extreameſt perill, muſt attend nothing, but how to ſettle beſt, that which lyes before them. I hold flying (if ever, certainely now, though it would preſerve us) not expedient. For a man born into this light, not to dy, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible: But for one that hath been an Emperour, to become a Exile, is not to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured: For let me never come to be without this purple robe, nor live that day, in which they that ſpeak to me, call me not their Lady and Miſtreſs. If Sir! you have a mind to eſcape, 'tis no hard matter. We have ſtore of money; and there's the ſea; and yonder are ſhipps: But conſider, whether you may not have cauſe, moſt willingly to exchange your ſafety, for death. For me, I like the old ſaying; How breave a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher a Kingdom is!</hi> At this ſpeech they took courage to ſtand it out, and conſulted of meanes of oppoſition, if any ſhould ſet upon them.</p>
               <p>All the Souldiers, both quartered about the Emperours Palace and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, neither affected the Emperour, nor durſt openly joyne in this action, but expected the event. But <hi>Juſtinians</hi> whole hope was in <hi>Beliſarius</hi> and <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus.</hi> The firſt newly come from the <hi>Perſian</hi> warr, had brought a ſtrong reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue with him, of <hi>Lanciers</hi> and <hi>Targettiers,</hi> and others, all old Souldiers. And <hi>Mundus,</hi> being<note n="*" place="margin">There was another cal'd Generall of all of the Orient; and two Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions in <hi>Byzan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium:</hi> In La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin their name was <hi>Magiſtri militum.</hi>
                  </note> Generall of <hi>Illyrium,</hi> chanced, being ſent for to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to bring with him a Troop of <hi>Herulians.</hi> But <hi>Hypatius</hi> in the <hi>Circus,</hi> went up directly, and ſate him down in the Emperours Seat, where he uſes to ſee the horſe races and other exerciſes. Then out of the Palace came <hi>Mundus,</hi> by the gate called <hi>Cochlea,</hi> from the round forme like a ſhell-ſnaile. But <hi>Beliſarius</hi> went firſt toward <hi>Hypatius,</hi> and the Imperiall Seat, and at a hall where uſes to be a guard of Souldiers, he called, willing the Souldiers to open the doores for him to goe againſt the Uſurper. The Souldiers reſolving to ſtand for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till one were cleerly the Conquerour, made as if they heard him not. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> returning to the <hi>Emperour,</hi> affirmed they were all undone; the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers revolting, who guarded the Palace. The Emperour bad him goe in by the Brazen gate, and the portall there; and he paſſing with much danger and toile, through rubbiſh, and places halfe burn't, got to the <hi>Circus.</hi> Being come to the Gallery of the <hi>Veneti,</hi> which is to the right hand of the Emperours Seat, he was thinking to ſet upon <hi>Hypatius;</hi> but the gate there was narrow, and he feared the people, ſeing him peſtred in a narrow paſſage, might cut in pieces himſelfe and his company, and then eaſily ſet upon the Emperour. So re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to give on upon the innumerable multitude, which ſtood confuſedly and crowded in the <hi>Circus,</hi> he drew his ſword, and bad the reſt doe the like, and ran upon them, with a great ſhout. The people being crouded together, and ſeing corſelets, and Souldiers of approved valour and experience, unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully hewing them with their ſwords, fell to running away. A fearfull cry was made, and <hi>Mundus</hi> ſtanding neer, and deſirous to have his ſhare in the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50471:23"/>action (being a daring man) when he ſaw <hi>Beliſarius</hi> in fight, he ruſht into the <hi>Circus</hi> alſo at the gate called <hi>Necra.</hi> And ſo the Mutineers between them both were cut in peeces. And the overthrow being clear, and much ſlaughter of the Commons, <hi>Boraides</hi> and <hi>Juſtus,</hi> the Emperours Nephews, pulled <hi>Hypatius</hi> out of his ſeat (none reſiſting) and led him with <hi>Pompeius</hi> to the Emperour; (of the common people there being ſlain that day more than 30000.) The Emperour commanded them to priſon; and <hi>Pompeius</hi> wept, being a man little verſed in buſineſs; but <hi>Hypatius</hi> chid him, ſaying, That none ought to lament for men periſhing unjuſtly; forced at the firſt by the people, and then coming to the <hi>Circus</hi> for no hurt to the Emperour: But the next day the ſouldiers killed them both, and threw their bodies into the ſea. The Emperour confiſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their eſtates, and of all the other Senators of their faction; but afterward reſtored to them, and to the ſonnes of <hi>Hypatius,</hi> and <hi>Pompeius,</hi> their former dignities, and ſo much of their eſtates, as he had not<note n="*" place="margin">But he gave away all their beſt lands and goods firſt.

                  <hi>TRibonianus</hi> and <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Cappadocian</hi> had their Offices reſtored to them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. <hi>Tribonianus</hi> lived many yeares in the ſame, and dyed in his bed, without receiving other diſgrace, being a faire ſpoken man, pleaſant, and able to vail his Covetouſneſs with abundance of Learning. But <hi>John</hi> was irkſome to all the world, threatning the whip to all men, and ſharking all kind of booty. In the tenth year of his Office he paid the juſt penalty of his lawleſs life in this manner.<note n="*" place="margin">This ſtory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins 8 years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Mutiny, and ends tenne years after it, when <hi>Iohn</hi> was ſtript of all, and ſent begging to <hi>Alexandria.</hi> As appears in the end of the Chapter.</note> The Empreſſe <hi>Theodora</hi> hated him of all men; and he being fallen foul with her by ſome errors, ſought not to gain her with flattery and good turnes, but openly plotted againſt her, and accuſed her to the Emperour; neither reſpecting her fortune, nor the Emperours extreame affection to her. She perceiving his doings, deſired to kill him, but could not, the Emperour ſo much eſteemed him. But <hi>John</hi> knowing the Empreſſes mind, was terribly affraid, ſuſpecting every night in his bed, ſome <hi>Barbarian</hi> ſhould ruſh in to kill him; and ſtill peeping out, and ſearching the entries, that he could not ſleep, though he had about him ſome thouſands of Lanciers and Targetiers; a thing never uſed by any Praefect. But no ſooner day; but again, forgetting all fear of God, or man, he became a common deſtruction to all <hi>Romans,</hi> frequenting Sorcerers, and hearkning to impious South-ſayings, vainly foretelling to him the Imperiall dignity; that one might ſee his thoughts in the air, tranſported with hopes of the Empire: And in his wicked courſe of life he bated nothing, nor was God in any of his thoughts. If he went to Church to pray, or watch all night, he obſerved not the Chriſtian Rites; but having on a courſe garment, like a Heathen Prieſt, he mumbled all the night ſome ungodly ſpels, to captivate more the Emperours mind, and to preſerve himſelf from miſchief.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> after the conqueſt of <hi>Italy,</hi> came to <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> with his wife <hi>Antonina,</hi> to manage the war againſt the <hi>Perſian,</hi> being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to all men, and indeed deſerving much eſtimation. Yet this <hi>John</hi> was harſh to him, and ſtill plotting againſt him; onely becauſe himſelf was generally hated, and <hi>Beliſarius</hi> of all men the moſt renowned. And the hope of the <hi>Romans</hi> being upon him, again he made an expedition into <hi>Perſia,</hi> leaving his wife <hi>Antonina</hi> in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> who (being the ableſt woman a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live to effect things hard to be effected) to gratifie the Empreſſe, deviſed this. <hi>John</hi> had a daughter, his onely child, named <hi>Euphemia,</hi> whom he extreamely loued, very modeſt, but young, and ſo eaſily caught. This mayd, <hi>Antonina,</hi> by much ſoothing, and aſſiduity, at laſt gained to her lure; not diſdaining to impart her ſecrets to her. And once having her above in a chamber, ſhe feigned to lament her own fortune, That <hi>Beliſarius</hi> (after ſo much enlarging the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and two Kings brought priſoners to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and ſo vaſt a wealth) found <hi>Juſtinian</hi> ungratefull; and in other things ſhe accuſed
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50471:23"/>the Government, as unjuſt. <hi>Euphemia</hi> overjoyed at this diſcourſe, being trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled too with the Government, and fear of the Empreſs; <q>Truly, dear Lady! (quoth ſhe) you are the cauſes, who having power, will not uſe it. We are not able, daughter (replyed <hi>Antonina</hi>) to ſtirre in the Camp, if ſome in the Court concurre not in the action: But if your Father would, wee ſhould eaſily (being once in the buſineſs) effect, whatſoever it ſhould pleaſe God.</q> 
                  <hi>Euphemia</hi> confidently promiſed, that this ſhould be done; and departing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the matter to her father. Who pleaſed with it, and conceiving it to lead him the way to his Propheſies, and the Empire, without pauſing upon it, conſented: Willing his daughter to treat for a meeting the next day, and that he might give her his oath. <hi>Antonina</hi> knowing his mind, and deſirous to draw him from ſuſpecting the truth: <q>To give him a meeting now (quoth ſhe) will doe hurt; it will cauſe ſuſpition, and hinder all: But ſhe was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to goe into the Eaſt to <hi>Beliſarius;</hi> being departed from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and in her houſe in the ſuburbs (which is called <hi>Rufinianae,</hi> a houſe of <hi>Beliſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>) there <hi>John</hi> ſhould come to take leave, and bring her on her way; where they might conferre, and give oath, and take it.</q> 
                  <hi>John</hi> liked this, and a day was aſſigned accordingly. The Empreſſe informed of all from <hi>Antonina,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the plot, and encouraged her in it. And at the day appointed, <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nina</hi> took leave of the Empreſs, and came to <hi>Rufinianae,</hi> and the next day was to begin her journey. Thither at night came <hi>John,</hi> to finiſh the agreement. The Empreſſe had informed her husband of theſe attempts of <hi>John</hi> to uſurp, and ſo ſent to <hi>Rufinianae Narſes</hi> the Eunuch, and <hi>Marcellus,</hi> Commander of the <hi>Palatine</hi> guards, with many ſouldiers, and direction to ſearch out the buſineſs, and if they found <hi>John</hi> in any plot, to kill him, and come away. They ſay the Emperour advertiſed of this proceeding, ſent one to <hi>John,</hi> not to meet <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nina</hi> ſecretly. Which adviſe <hi>John</hi> neglecting (it being his fate to be ruined) about midnight met <hi>Antonina</hi> near a hedge, behind which ſhe had placed <hi>Narſes,</hi> and <hi>Marcellus,</hi> to hear what was ſaid. There did <hi>John</hi> conſent in plain words to the conſpiracy, and confirmed it with moſt terrible oaths. Then did <hi>Narſes</hi> and <hi>Marcellus,</hi> break in upon him. But at the noiſe, <hi>Johns</hi> Lanciers (who were at hand) came preſently in. One of them wounded <hi>Marcellus</hi> with his ſword, not knowing who it was; whereby <hi>John</hi> with them eſcaped, and ran to the City. If he had had the heart to goe immediately to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, he had had no hurt, I verily think: But by flying to the Temple, he gave the Empreſſe full ſcope to advance her deſign againſt him. So that of a Praefect made a private man, and removed from that Church, he was brought to another, ſtanding in a ſuburb of <hi>Cyzicum,</hi> called <hi>Artâce,</hi> and there made a Prieſt, naming himſelf <hi>Peter.</hi> He was not made a Biſhop, but a Prieſt: Neither would he execute the function of a Prieſt, leſt it ſhould hinder his promotion to greater offices. For he would not lay down his hopes. His eſtate being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcate, the Emperour remitted much of it, being ſtill inclined to ſpare him. There had <hi>John</hi> the means (ſecure from dangers, and rich, both by what he had collected himſelf, and what he had by the Emperours grace) to uſe his pleaſures without controlement, and with moderation to eſteem his eſtate happy. At which all men repined, that being the wickedeſt devil in the world, he ſhould thus live happyer than he did before.</p>
               <p>But God would not ſuffer his puniſhment to ſtay there, but prepared this greater ſcourge for him. <hi>Euſebius,</hi> the biſhop of <hi>Cyzicum,</hi> was as harſh a man as <hi>John</hi> himſelf. And him the <hi>Cyzicenians</hi> accuſed to the Emperour in a judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall way; but not prevailing (<hi>Euſebius</hi> being too ſtrong for them) ſome young men laid wait, and killed him in the Market-place of <hi>Cyzicum.</hi> With this <hi>Euſebius John</hi> had great differences, which caſt a ſuſpition of the fact upon him. So that ſome Senators being ſent to examine it, firſt put him in the common priſon, ſetting him naked like a robber, or ſome pilfering rogue (one who had been ſo powerfull a Praefect, enrolled among the <hi>Patricians,</hi> and had ſate in the <hi>Conſuls</hi> chair, then which dignity none is greater in the <hi>Roman</hi> ſtate) and tearing his back with many ſtripes, they forced him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal his own life. There was no great argument of his guilt of the murder;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50471:24"/>but the juſtice of God exacted from him a revenge, for abuſing the whole world. They took then all his eſtate from him, and put him naked into a ſhip, ſave with one courſe coat, which coſt not much. His conductors, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the ſhip put in, made him beg his bread, and ſmall moneys for his ſubſiſtence. And ſo begging all the way to <hi>Egypt,</hi> he was brought to <hi>Antinoë</hi> and this is the third year of his being there a priſoner. Yet in all this affliction, he quitted not his hope of the Empire; but fell to accuſe ſome <hi>Alexandrians:</hi> for Arrears to the Treaſury.</p>
               <p>This juſt vengeance fell upon <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Cappadocian,</hi> ten years after this time. But then the Emperour made <hi>Beliſarius</hi> Generall of the Eaſt again, and ſending him into <hi>Africa,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anno Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni 533. &amp; Iuſtiniani 7.</note> recovered the country, as ſhall be hereafter declared; which much vexed <hi>Choſroes</hi> and the <hi>Perſians,</hi> repenting they had made a peace, when he ſaw the <hi>Romans</hi> power ſo augmented. And ſending an Ambaſſadour to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> he congratulated with the Emperour, and in merriment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his ſhare of the ſpoyles of <hi>Africa,</hi> ſeeing he had not vanquiſhed the <hi>Vandales,</hi> if the <hi>Perſians</hi> had not made peace with him. But <hi>Juſtinian</hi> ſent <hi>Choſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roës</hi> a preſent in money, and diſmiſſed the Ambaſſadour.</p>
               <p>In the mean time at <hi>Daras</hi> one <hi>John,</hi> a ſouldier of the Garriſon (ſome few of his fellow ſouldiers conſpiring) uſurped, and poſſeſſed the City. In the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace there, as in a Cittadell) he ſate, confirming dayly his tyranny: And had not there been peace then with the <hi>Perſians,</hi> ſome deſperate miſchief had fallen out. The fourth day of this tyranny, ſome other ſouldiers, by the direction of <hi>Mamas</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Daras,</hi> and <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> a principall Citizen, went to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace at noon, each having under his caſſock a ſhort ſword. And firſt at the inner court, finding ſome few Lanciers of the guard, they killed them; then going into the Hall, layd hold on the uſurper. Some ſay the ſouldiers did not begin with him; but that (they demurring upon it in the inner court, afraid of the danger) a pudding ſeller in their company ruſht in ſuddainly upon <hi>John,</hi> and with his knife wounded him; not mortally. But flying in haſte, he fell among the ſouldiers, and then (they ſay) they laid hold on him; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſet the place on fire, that it might not encourage any hereafter to rebell, they put him fettred in the common priſon. Where one among them, fearing, that the ſouldiers knowing him to be living, might trouble the City again, killed him, and ſo appeaſed the mutiny, and the ſaid tyranny in <hi>Daras.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hoſroes</hi> hearing how <hi>Beliſarius</hi> was recovering <hi>Italy</hi> for the Emperour <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> could hold no longer, but would find ſome ſpecious pretext to break the peace: <hi>Alamundarus</hi> he directed to procure cauſes of a warr. Who charging <hi>Arethas</hi> for encroaching on him, with that colour forraged the <hi>Romans;</hi> alledging it no breach of peace between them and the <hi>Perſians;</hi> neither having included him. Indeed in no treaties was any mention of the <hi>Saracens;</hi> being comprehended in the names of the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Perſians.</hi> The Country theſe <hi>Saracens</hi> diſputed, is called <hi>Strata,</hi> and lies to the South of the City of <hi>Palmyra.</hi> Trees nor Corne it hath none, (being parcht with Sun,) onely it affoards ſome flocks of Sheep. <hi>Arethas</hi> claimed it for the <hi>Romans</hi> from the name it had (<hi>Strata</hi> in Latin being a paved way) and producing teſtimonies of ancient men: But <hi>Alamun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darus</hi> would not diſpute about names, alledging the owners to have anciently paid him rent for the paſturage. <hi>Juſtinian</hi> committed the arbitration of theſe differences to <hi>Strategius,</hi> a Patrician, ſuperintendent of his treaſures, a wiſe man, and nobly born, and to <hi>Summus</hi> late Captain of the Forces in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> and brother to <hi>Julian,</hi> (who was Ambaſſador to the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> and <hi>Homerits</hi>) who thought it not ſit the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould quit the Country. But <hi>Strategius</hi> prayed the Emperour, not to give the <hi>Perſians,</hi> (now quarrelling,) occaſion for a warr, about ſuch a poore barren Country. Who conſulted about it, and much time was ſpent in the Arbitration. But <hi>Choſroes</hi> ſaid the peace was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, in that <hi>Juſtinian</hi> during the ſame had manifeſted a great deſigne upon his houſe, by endeavouring to gaine from him <hi>Alamundarus; Summus</hi> at the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitration having importuned him with great offers of money to revolt. <hi>Choſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes</hi> alſo produced the Emperours letters written to <hi>Alamundarus;</hi> And he alledged, that he had alſo written to the <hi>Hunnes</hi> to invade and forrage the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:50471:26"/>and that the <hi>Hunnes</hi> had ſent him the Letters. <hi>Choſroes</hi> with theſe obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, (true, or falſe, I know not) reſolved to break the peace.</p>
               <p>Then alſo <hi>Vitigis</hi> King of the <hi>Goths,</hi> brought low with the warr there, ſent two Ambaſſadours to him, to perſuade his invading the <hi>Romans;</hi> being not <hi>Goths,</hi> (for feare of ſpoiling the buſineſs being diſcovered) but <hi>Ligurian</hi> prieſts, won to this negotiation by large gifts. He that ſeemed the better man, and called himſelf a Biſhop, went for the Ambaſſadour, and the other for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. Being come into <hi>Thrace,</hi> they took in an Interpreter for the <hi>Syrian</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> tongues; and ſo came into <hi>Perſia</hi> undiſcovered; the <hi>Romans</hi> keeping no exact guards becauſe of the peace: And having acceſſe to <hi>Choſroes,</hi> they ſpake thus; <hi>Other men, O King! employ Ambaſſadors for ends of their own: But</hi> Vitigis <hi>King of the</hi> Goths <hi>and</hi> Italians, <hi>having ſent us to adviſe you concerning your Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, thinck him, as preſent, to ſay thus. In a word, O King! you abandon your owne Empire, and all men beſides, to</hi> Juſtinian; <hi>who being naturally pragmaticall, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, and reſtleſſe, hath ſtrong deſires to conquer every Land and Dominion. But finding himſelf unable to deale ſingly with the</hi> Perſians, <hi>nor during their oppoſition, to aſſaile others; he reſolved to blind you with a Peace, and to compell others to joyne their powers to his, againſt your Dominions. The</hi> Vandales <hi>and</hi> Moores <hi>he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ruined, by removing us out of his way with a title of friendſhip: And now fully ſtored with money, and men, he invades us: ſhewing, that if he can ſubdue the</hi> Goths; <hi>with us, and the ſlaves he hath already made, he will bring his Army up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the</hi> Perſians, <hi>reſpecting no name of friendſhip, nor his Oath. So that while there is yet hope, doe us no more hurt, nor ſuffer any your ſelfe; but in our misfortunes, ſee what may happen to the</hi> Perſians. <hi>Thinck the</hi> Romans <hi>never your friends, but once above you in power, that they will conſummate their hatred. Uſe your power in the due time, leaſt you ſeek it, when 'tis gone. The point of opportunity once blunted, never recovers. 'Tis better to prevent and be ſafe; then coming ſhort of the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to ſuffer the baſeſt things from an Enemy. Choſroes</hi> eſteemed this Counſell of <hi>Vitigis</hi> to be good; and ſtudied more the breaking the peace; in his envy of <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> not conſidering theſe diſcourſes to come from the Emperours Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. He had a mind to it, and ſo like a willing fugitive he yeilded himſelf: which happened alſo to him upon the diſcourſes of the <hi>Armenians</hi> and <hi>Lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> afterward. They imputed to <hi>Juſtinian</hi> that, which is the high praiſe of a generous Emperour, the making his Empire greater and more glorious; which they might aſwell object to <hi>Cyrus</hi> the <hi>Perſian,</hi> or <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donian.</hi> But envious men know no right: And thus <hi>Chorſroes</hi> reſolved to breake the peace.</p>

He at firſt made a ſlow warr, ſtriving to appeaſe, and reduce them to their former affections; promiſing to get their new tribute remitted. But the Emperour, at the inſtigation of <hi>Adolius,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Acacius,</hi> reproach't him for dallying. Then he prepared to give battell, endeavouring with faire
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50471:26"/>promiſes to joyne ſome, to have the reſt better cheape. The <hi>Apetians,</hi> a great and populous people, willing to ſubmit, ſent to him for aſſurance; that turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Roman</hi> Army from their own Countrey-men, they ſhould enjoy their own eſtates, free from grievance. He gladly made an Inſtrument of their aſſurances, and ſent it them ſigned; and confident upon this to winne the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell without ſtriking ſtroke, he marcht to the <hi>Oenochalaces,</hi> where the <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> encamped. But the bearers of the Inſtrument could not meet the <hi>Apeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> and part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, not knowing of the accord, killed ſome few of them they met. And <hi>Sittas</hi> finding ſome children and women in a cave, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry for the <hi>Apetians</hi> not joining according to promiſe, or not knowing them, killed them. So they ſtood in battell with the reſt, offended with all this. The fight could not be in one place, but was ſcattered in ragged ground, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipices, and bottomes of hills. So that <hi>Sittas</hi> not with many, and ſome few <hi>Armenians,</hi> came neer each other, with a deep vally between them; being both ſides horſe-men: <hi>Sittas</hi> paſt the vally, and charged the enemy; who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring, ſtood ſtill, and <hi>Sittas</hi> ſtopt there too. By chance an <hi>Herulian</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> army came back in fury from the chaſe of an enemy, paſſing by <hi>Sittas,</hi> who had ſtruck his lance into the ground, The <hi>Herulians</hi> horſe ruſhing main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt it, brake it; which much troubled <hi>Sittas.</hi> For an <hi>Armenian</hi> who knew him (having his helmet off) aſſured the reſt it was <hi>Sittas.</hi> Who hearing what the <hi>Armenian</hi> ſaid, and ſeeing his lance crackt upon the ground, drew his ſword, and would have retreated over the vally. The Enemy rode eagerly after him, and one overtook him in the vally with a ſword, which cut off the crown of his head, not hurting the ſcull. <hi>Sittas</hi> ſpurr'd on; but <hi>Artabanes,</hi> the ſon of <hi>John,</hi> of the race of the <hi>Arſacides,</hi> kill'd him with a thruſt of his lance behind. Thus was <hi>Sittas</hi> loſt impertinently, and not ſutably to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer actions; A goodly man he was, valiant, and an excellent Commander, inferiour to none of his time. Some ſay one <hi>Solomon</hi> killed him, an obſcure fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and not <hi>Artabanes.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sittas</hi> being dead, the Emperour ſent <hi>Buzes</hi> againſt the <hi>Armenians.</hi> Who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neer them, promiſed to reconcile them, deſiring conference with ſome of their chief men. None would give credit to <hi>Buzes,</hi> nor hearken to his offers, ſave <hi>John,</hi> the father of <hi>Artabanes</hi> his friend, of the race of the <hi>Arſacides,</hi> who preſuming upon <hi>Buzes,</hi> as his friend, came to him with his ſon in law <hi>Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaces,</hi> and ſome others. Theſe the next day lodged where they were to meet <hi>Buzes,</hi> and perceaved themſelves compaſs't with the <hi>Roman</hi> army. <hi>Baſſaces,</hi> when he could not perſwade <hi>John</hi> to flie, rode back, leaving him all alone; whom <hi>Buzes</hi> kill'd.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Armenians</hi> having no hope of reconciliation, and unable to maintaine the warr; under the conduct of <hi>Baſſaces,</hi> a valiant man, betook themſelves to the <hi>Perſian</hi> King: To whom ſome of their Chiefs being admitted, ſpake thus. <hi>There are amongſt us, Sir! many</hi> Arſacides, <hi>deſcendants of that</hi> Arſaces, <hi>who no ſtranger to the</hi> Perſian <hi>Empire, when it was under the</hi> Parthians, <hi>was a famous King in his time, inferiour to none. But we now ſtand before you, become ſlaves and fugitives, not willingly, but forced; in apparance by the</hi> Romans, <hi>but indeed, O King! by your reſolution. For who gives power to the wrong doer, juſtly beares the blame of the wrong. To deduce it higher, and through the ſeverall occurrents,</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaces, <hi>our laſt King, quitted his Royalty, it ſeemes, willingly to</hi> Theodoſius <hi>the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Emperour, with condition for thoſe of his blood, to enjoy libertie, and not to be ſubject to Tribute. Which we preſerved till your famous Peace, or rather common ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitie. For now not regarding friends nor enemies, this friend of yours, O King! in words, and enemy in deeds, hath troubled all the world. Which your ſelfe will know ere long, when he hath ſubdued the Weſtern Nations. What thing prohibited hath he not done! what well ſettled not ſtirred? Hath he not taxed us with unuſuall tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes? made ſlaves of the</hi> Tzanians <hi>our borderers, a free people? ſet a Governour over the King of the wretched</hi> Lazians, <hi>a thing not incident to the nature of things? not to be expreſt? Hath he not with his Generalls unjuſtly ſurprized the</hi> Boſporites, <hi>ſubjects of the</hi> Hunnes? <hi>made league with the</hi> Ethiopians, <hi>never heard of by the</hi> Romans? <hi>added the</hi> Homerits, <hi>red Sea, and Country of</hi> Palme-trees <hi>to the</hi> Roman

                  <hi>Empire? not to ſpeak of the</hi> Affricans <hi>and</hi> Italians. <hi>The whole world not containing the man, he ſearches gulfes beyond the Ocean, and another world. Why doe you delay, O King! reſpecting this wicked ruinous peace? Is it, after all the reſt, to be his laſt diſh? To know what man</hi> Juſtinian <hi>is to them that yeild to him, you have us for a Precedent, and the poore</hi> Lazians: <hi>how he uſes men unknown, as well as them that wrong him; conſider the</hi> Vandales, Goths <hi>and</hi> Moores. <hi>But the maine of all: ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies he not during the peace to draw</hi> Alamundarus <hi>your ſervant to revolt from you? to aſſociate the</hi> Hunnes <hi>againſt you, men unknown to him? But a ſhrewder act then this was never: Now he perceaves his Weſterne conqueſts ready for concluſion, he ſeeks to circumvent the</hi> Eaſt, <hi>having none now to wreſtle with left, but the</hi> Perſians. <hi>So that himſelf hath broken the Perpetuall Peace. They break peace, not who arme firſt, but who plot againſt their allies in time of peace, and the crime is acted by him that goes about to do it, though the ſucceſs faile. And not they who cauſe the warr, but they who oppoſe them, uſe to conquer. Nor will the match be equall; their beſt Souldiers being in the utmoſt parts of the world; and of their two beſt Generalls, we have lately ſlaine</hi> Sittas; <hi>and</hi> Beliſarius Juſtinian <hi>will not look on.

Caſtles; deſtroyed <hi>Caſſandria</hi> (anciently <hi>Potidaea</hi>) having never, (that we know) attempted before a walled Town; and with much boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſome 120. thouſand captives retired home, meeting no oppoſition: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward they did many miſchiefs to the <hi>Romans</hi> in their inroads.<note place="margin">He calls the Jonian Gulfe that which is called the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driatique Sea.</note> They aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted the wall in <hi>Cherſoneſus,</hi> and forcing the Guards, and at full Sea (being upon the Gulf called <hi>Melas</hi>) getting over it, entred within it, fell ſuddainly upon the <hi>Roman</hi> inhabitants in <hi>Cherſoneſus,</hi> ſlew many, and made almoſt all the reſt ſlaves. Some croſs't the Strait between <hi>Seſtus</hi> and <hi>Abidus,</hi> ſpoiled the towns of <hi>Aſia Minor,</hi> and then returning to <hi>Cherſoneſus,</hi> went home with the reſt of their army and their booty. In another inroad having ſpoyled <hi>Illy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium</hi> and <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> they aſſaulted the wall at <hi>Thermopylae;</hi> where the Garriſon defending ſtoutly, they unluckily found the path up the mountaine, and ſo waſted all <hi>Greece,</hi> ſave <hi>Peloponeſus;</hi> and then retired.</p>
               <p>Not long after the <hi>Perſians</hi> breaking the peace, did much infeſt the <hi>Romans</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt; Beliſarius</hi> having newly ſubdued <hi>Vitigis,</hi> and brought him to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople.</hi> Before the <hi>Perſian</hi> invaſion, <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> who ſaw <hi>Choſroes</hi> (as I have ſaid) quarrelling, ſent a remonſtrance to him by <hi>Anaſtaſius,</hi> a prudent man, who lately had ſuppreſſed the Rebellion at <hi>Daras,</hi> and wrote letters to this effect. <hi>Wiſe men, who know God, ſtrive to root up the occaſions of warr, eſpecially with their beſt friends. But men unadviſed, and raſhly affecting even God for their enemy,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50471:27"/>contrive cauſes, which are no cauſes, of ſights and troubles. To break a peace, and run into a warr, is an eaſie matter. The nature of things makes the worſt courſes eaſieſt to worthleſs men. But to finiſh a warr to ones mind, and to get peace againe, is not ſo eaſie. You complaine of letters, which by me were written with no all pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; but by you are interpreted with a ſenſe, ſuch as conduces to the execution of your own counſells with ſome pretence. But we can alledge your</hi> Alamundarus <hi>his forraging our countryes, and acting deſperate things during the peace; ſucking our Towns, ranſacking, killing, enſlaving our people; ſo that you are not to complaine, but to excuſe. The complaints of wrong doers are proved by actions, not diſcourſes. And we, notwithſtanding all this, reſolved to obſerve the peace; while you ſeek warr, and coine complaints, which concerne not us. Men ſeriouſly embracing quiet, ſhake off complaints againſt friends, though they preſſe hard: But ſuch, whom the articles of their friendſhip diſpleaſe, ſtudy for pretexts: A thing not becoming ordinary men, much leſſe Kings. Lay then theſe things by; and conſider the multitudes to periſh in this warr; and who ſhall beare the blame of what ſhall happen in it. Conſider the oath you took when you receaved your money, which you ſlight now, but can with no ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry evade. God is of a more excellent nature, then to be coſened by all the men living. Choſroes</hi> would not anſwer any thing to this Letter, nor diſmiſſe <hi>Anaſtaſius.</hi>

So he took up the Biſhop very courteouſly, receaved his preſent, and pretended to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with ſome chief men about the ranſome, and then to ſatisfie his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; and ſo ſent him away without the leaſt jealouſie of his deſigne. With him he ſent a convoy of <hi>Perſians,</hi> whom he inſtructed to go to the Town, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting the Biſhop with hopes; that himſelf and company might be ſeen by the Townſmen cheerfull without feare, and when the guards opened the gate for

                  <hi>CHoſroës,</hi> this done, marcht forward. The Generall-ſhip of the Eaſt the Emperour had ſo divided, as that all to the <hi>Euphrates</hi> was left to <hi>Beliſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> (who formerly had the whole command) and from thence to the <hi>Perſian</hi> frontier, all was under <hi>Buzes,</hi> and till <hi>Beliſarius</hi> ſhould returne out of <hi>Italy,</hi> he had the charge of the whole Eaſt; who firſt lay at <hi>Hierapolis</hi> with all the army. But underſtanding what happened to the <hi>Surenians,</hi> he called to him the chief men of <hi>Hierapolis,</hi> and told them; <q>That when the match is equall, there is reaſon to fight quickly with an enemy invading; but to men much weaker than their enemy, it is more expedient to circumvent him with ſtratagems, then to run into an evident danger: What forces <hi>Choſroës</hi> hath, they have heard. That if they make the war from the walls, the <hi>Perſians</hi> will block them up; and furniſh themſelves with proviſions out of their country (none oppoſing) while they want within; and that the ſiege laſting, their walls cannot hold out, being very aſſaultable, nor can the <hi>Romans</hi> but fall into ſome deſperate eſtate. But that guarding the City with part of the army, and lodging the reſt in the bottoms of the mountaines near the City, infeſting the enemies camp, and his forragers with ſuddain courſes, they will force him to raiſe his ſiege, unable to make his aſſaults at his eaſe, nor to provide food for ſo great an army.</q> The adviſe of <hi>Euzes</hi> ſeemed pertinent, but he did nothing; but went away with the choiceſt men of the army; and in what part of the world he was, neither the <hi>Romans</hi> in <hi>Hierapolis,</hi> nor the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy could learn. <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> hearing of the invaſion, diſpatcht <hi>Germanus,</hi> his brothers ſonne, in much haſte with three hundred men, promiſing to ſend a great army ſoon after. Who came to <hi>Antioch,</hi> viſited the walls, and found much of them of good ſtrength; the plain ground was compaſt by the river <hi>Orontes,</hi> and the hill was ſteep, craggy, and unapproachable; onely at the top
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50471:28"/>of mount <hi>Caſius,</hi> he found the wall very aſſaultable, from a rock ſtretching far in bredth, and as high as the wall. He directed therefore, either to cut the rock from the wall, that none from it might get up, or elſe to joyn it to the wall by a tower upon it. But workmen found both theſe impoſſible, in ſo ſhort time with an enemy ſo near, and to beginne and not perfect it, would but ſhew the enemy where to make their war. <hi>Germanus</hi> failing in this, and after long time ſeeing no army from the Emperour, nor likelyhood of any, fearing <hi>Choſroës</hi> might make it his chiefe buſineſs to take <hi>Antioch,</hi> hearing the Emperours Nephew to be within it; and the <hi>Antiochians</hi> having the ſame thoughts, reſolved all in counſell to buy their ſafety with money. And to <hi>Choſroës</hi> they ſent <hi>Megas,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Berrhoea,</hi> a prudent man; who finding the <hi>Perſians</hi> not far from <hi>Hierapolis,</hi> and being admitted to <hi>Choſroës,</hi> beſought <q>him to pitty men who never offended him, nor were in caſe to reſiſt him. That it is not fit for a King to uſe violence againſt yeelding men; nor ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous to give the Emperour no time to conſult, either for rectifying the peace, or for preparations to war, by a mutuall conſent; and to invade thus without warning; their Emperour not knowing in what caſe they are.</q> The rude nature of <hi>Choſroës</hi> could not be put in tune by diſcreet words; they rather more ſwell'd him with pride and folly; threatning to deſtroy all the <hi>Syrians</hi> and <hi>Cilicians;</hi> and he bade <hi>Megas</hi> follow him. Then he encamped before <hi>Hierapolis;</hi> which finding ſtrong, and a good garriſon within, he ſent <hi>Paul</hi> his interpreter to demand money of them; <hi>Paul</hi> was bred up in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Territory, and went to a Grammar-ſchool in <hi>Antioch,</hi> and was thought to be deſcended of <hi>Romans.</hi> The citizens fearing their walls, which embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a great circuit to the mountaine; and willing to ſave their country from ſpoyling, agreed to give two thouſand pound weight of ſilver.<note place="margin">5250. <abbr>l'.</abbr> ſterl.</note> And <hi>Megas</hi> obtained of <hi>Choſroës</hi> with much intreating,<note place="margin">31500. <abbr>l'.</abbr> ſterl.</note> to accept * ten <hi>Centenaries</hi> of gold for all the Eaſterne provinces, and ſo to leave them. <hi>Megas</hi> returned to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch;</hi> and <hi>Choſroës</hi> having his money for <hi>Hierapolis,</hi> marcht to <hi>Berrhoea,</hi> ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Hierapolis,</hi> from either two dayes journey. But the fourth day, <hi>Megas,</hi> with few in company, came to <hi>Antioch;</hi> and the <hi>Perſian</hi> army to the ſuburbs of <hi>Berrhoea. Choſroës</hi> urged the <hi>Berrhoeans</hi> by <hi>Paul</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter, for twice as much money as <hi>Hierapolis</hi> gave, becauſe their walls were weak, nor could they truſt to them. They yeelded to his demand, pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down 2000 <abbr>l.</abbr> weight of ſilver, but the other 2000 <abbr>l.</abbr> alledging they could not pay down; and he urging them, they fled by night to the Caſtle in the high town. The next day, they that came from him to receive the reſt of the money, found the gates ſhut, and could ſpeak with none. The King under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it, by his command they entred the Citie with ſcaling ladders, none reſiſting; and opening the gates let in all the army. <hi>Choſroës</hi> in a rage would have burnt the City; but firſt he would take in the Caſtle; where ſome <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> ſouldiers defended valiantly, and killed ſome enemies. But the <hi>Berrhoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> flying to the caſtle with all their horſes and cattell, by that niggardly trick were undone; for there being but one ſpring, and all the cattell ſuffred improvidently to drink up the water, the ſpring became dry; and in ſuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate they were.</p>

But <hi>Megas</hi> arrived at <hi>Berrhoea;</hi> and much afflicted
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50471:29"/>with what happened, complained to <hi>Choſroes</hi> for this perfideous uſage, to ſend him to <hi>Antioch</hi> about truce, and in the mean time to ranſack his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, who never wrong'd him; to block them up thus in the Caſtle, and burn and ruin their city. Your ſelf, Sir (anſwered <hi>Choſroës</hi>) are too blame, making me loſe my time here, and returning ſo long after the day appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For your countrymen; they contracted to pay money, which as yet they cannot think of performing; but preſumptuous in their ſtrong Caſtle, they put us, as you ſee, to the neceſſity of a ſiege: Whom I hope with the help of the Gods ſhortly to chaſtiſe for it, and for my <hi>Perſians</hi> here loſt. <hi>Megas</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed; <q>If all muſt be ſilent, while you, a King, accuſe wretched men; then am I bound to confeſſe without diſputing; abſolute power, as in all the reſt, muſt overcome in words. But if one may (laying aſide reſpects) ſtand for truth; O King! you have nothing juſtly to charge us with. I went the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of your propoſitions to <hi>Antioch,</hi> and returning the ſeventh day (then which what can be more ſpeedy) I find my country thus uſed by you. Who having abandoned all that is moſt precious, have nothing now left, but to fight for their lives; and the advantage of not paying the reſt of the mony; it being impoſſible for men to pay what they have not. Names are ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defined for things; Diſability is one thing, and Ingratitude another. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, he that wantonly refuſes, is with reaſon hated; but one by diſability driven to the ſame point, is to be pittyed rather. Though the worſt things are befallen us, yet, Sir! leave us with this comfort, not to have been au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours of our own misfortunes. Think what you have received, to be the whole ſumme; and enough; not weighing it by your own greatneſſe, but by the the <hi>Berrhoeans</hi> ability. Force us no further; leaſt at laſt you ſeem to want power; ſeeing exceſſive undertakings ever are rewarded with unfaiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs. The moſt powerfull way is to attempt no Impoſſibles. Let this be our apology for the preſent: But if I might ſpeak with the poor men; I might ſay ſomething, now not thought of.</q> 
                  <hi>Choſroës</hi> permitted him to goe to the Caſtle; who finding there what happened to their ſpring, weeping, he came back to <hi>Choſroës,</hi> and falling flat upon the ground, proteſted, the <hi>Berrhoeans</hi> had no money; and beſought him to beſtow the bodies of the poor men upon him. Which <hi>Choſroës</hi> granted upon his lamentable crying, and gave his faith to all in the Caſtle.

               <p>BUt then, hearing from <hi>Megas,</hi> that the <hi>Antiochians</hi> would give no mony, he marcht againſt them, where ſome were fled the City with their goods, and the reſt reſolved the like, if <hi>Theoctiſtus</hi> and <hi>Molathes,</hi> Captains of the forces in <hi>Phoenicia Libani,</hi> had not with a ſupply of 6000 old ſouldiers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged them, and ſtayd their flight.

The <hi>Perſians</hi> having <hi>Choſroës</hi> preſent, and crying loud unto them, ſtrove beyond power, giving no ſpace to the other to ſpie or ward their ſhot. But the <hi>Romans</hi> preſſing up to defend, the ropes under them which tyed the beames ſuddainly brake, and down they all fell: They who made good the next Turret, hearing the noiſe, thinking the wall to be thrown down there, ran away. Some young citizens only, who uſed to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell in the <hi>Circus,</hi> would run no further; being come down from the wall. But the old ſouldiers, with <hi>Theoctiſtus</hi> and <hi>Molatzes,</hi> lept on their horſes, which ſtood ready, and rode to the gate, giving out that they went to receive in <hi>Buzes</hi> with an army with him. Thither ran alſo the <hi>Antiochians,</hi> men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and children, and the place being narrow, they tumbled over one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, overborn with the horſes; and the ſouldiers ſparing none, but rather urging on faſter, that there was a great ſlaughter made. But the <hi>Perſians</hi> ſet their ſcaling ladders, and mounted, none oppoſing; and a while ſtayd upon the battlements, as if doubtful, and diſcovering; leſt there might be ambuſhes in the rough waſte ground, among rocks and precipices, which is within the walls, upon the deſcent from the hill. Some ſay it was upon the adviſe of <hi>Choſroës,</hi> who perceiving the bad ground, and the ſouldiers running away, feared to neceſſitate their turning head upon him, which might hinder him from taking the greateſt, faireſt, moſt populous, richeſt, and happieſt <hi>Roman</hi> City in the Eaſt; than which eſteeming leſſe all things elſe, he reſolved to give the ſouldiers fair leiſure to run away: ſo that the <hi>Perſians</hi> pointed with their hands to them, and bade them make haſte away. And they did ſo, with their Commanders, going out of the gate of <hi>Daphne,</hi> a ſuburbe of <hi>Antioch,</hi> with ſome few of the common people; the <hi>Perſians</hi> having onely not medled with that gate, who when they ſaw the ſouldiers gone far, they deſcended, and from the hill fell into the midſt of the City. Some young men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred them, ſome armed with corſlets, but moſt unarmed; onely throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtones, and driving them off a little, they ſeemed to have the better, and ſung their <hi>Paeans,</hi> and cryed Emperour <hi>Juſtinian, Callinicus,</hi> or the fair Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour, as it they had the victory indeed. In the mean time <hi>Choſroës</hi> ſent for the Ambaſſadours to ſpeak with them, ſitting upon the Turret by the top of the hill; when <hi>Zaberganes,</hi> one of his commanders, conceiving the conference would be for a compoſition, came to him haſtily, and ſayd: <q>O Maſter! you differ from the <hi>Romans</hi> themſelves, to think to preſerve theſe men, who before the danger flout your Majeſty, and being beaten, dare im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilities and deſperate acts upon the <hi>Perſians;</hi> as if they feared your hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity ſhould pitty men, ſcorning preſervation, and ſpare them, that will not be ſpared; ſuch as lay ambuſhes for, and kill their Conquerours in a town taken, their own garriſon having forſaken them.</q> 
                  <hi>Choſroës</hi> at this, ſent many of his beſt men againſt them; who brought him word, that all was well; the <hi>Perſians</hi> having by their numbers routed the <hi>Antiochians,</hi> with much ſlaughter, ſparing no age. Two wives of Noblemen of <hi>Antioch</hi> are reported to have gotten without the walls, and that ſeeing the enemies coming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them on all ſides, and fearing to be taken, and abuſed, they ran to the river <hi>Orontes,</hi> and covering their faces with their veils, lept into it, and were drowned. So every ſpecies of miſery fell upon the <hi>Antiochians.</hi> Then did <hi>Choſroës</hi> ſpeak thus to the Ambaſſadours. <q>The old ſaying, I ſee, is true; God ever gives the good mingled with the evill; ſo that we have not ſo much as laughter, which we repent not of. Good fortune is attended with
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50471:30"/>ſome croſs, and pleaſure with grief, ſuffering no proſperity untainted. This city, the moſt renowned of the <hi>Roman</hi> dominion, I have taken without la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; God hath given me, (you ſee) a ſuddaine victory. Yet to behold the ſlaughter of ſuch multitudes, &amp; my trophy died with ſo much blood, it takes away the pleaſure: And hereof are the miſerable <hi>Antiochians</hi> guilty; who being not able to beat off the <hi>Perſians,</hi> have yet with ſenceleſs raſhneſs ſought their own deaths, ſtrugling under the yoak againſt men conquering them ſo eaſily. My chief men importune me to compaſs the city, and deſtroy every man in it: But I, to preſerve them, direct rather to drive them on that fly; as being impious to inſult on men under my power.</q> This <hi>Choſroes</hi> ſpake in a vaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affected way to the Ambaſſadours; who ſaw for what reaſons he gave the <hi>Romans</hi> leyſure to run away. He was the ſhrewdeſt man living to ſpeak things that were not; to conceale the truth; and to lay the blame upon men he wrong'd, for the faults done by himſelf; Ever ready to agree to any thing, and ſweare to it; but more ready to forget both agreement and oath; skillfull to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe his mind to any abomination for money, and yet in his countenance to pretend piety, and in words to deteſt the action. As when he ſo treacherouſly ruined the <hi>Surenians,</hi> who never wrong'd him. Eſpying a principall matrone (the town being taken) drag'd violently by her left hand by a <hi>Barbarian,</hi> and with the other haling after her her little child newly weaned, and fallen to the ground, which ſhe would not let goe, it being not able to keep pace; Here he ſhewed his very humour; Groaning, and ſeeming to the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers by, ſpecially <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> the Ambaſſadour to weep, he pray'd God to puniſh the Authors of thoſe things; intimating the Emperour; though he knew well himſelf to be the onely authour. With this ſtrange bad na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he became King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> after rejection of the gallant <hi>Zames,</hi> for his one eye; and of the eldeſt <hi>Caoſes,</hi> for his Fathers reaſonleſs hatred; and he prevailed eaſily againſt his oppugners; and to the <hi>Romans</hi> did even as much miſchief, as he deſired. Thus Fortune, reſolving to make a man great, ever acts her reſolution in the fit time (none oppoſing the ſtrong current of her will,) ſhe regards not the worth of the man, nor avoids things ſeeming unfit, nor cares for the worlds rayling for having advanced one not deſerving her grace; In brief, not thinking upon any thing, but how to bring her purpoſe to effect.</p>

                  <hi>CHoſroes</hi> commanded his army to make ſlaves of the <hi>Antiochians</hi> ſurviving, and to ranſack their eſtates; and himſelf with the Ambaſſadors went down from the Hill to the Church. Here he found ſo great treaſures of gold and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that had he taken no other ſpoile, he had gone away with a huge wealth. He took down many admirable pieces of marble, which he Commanded to lay without the walls, to be carried into <hi>Perſia;</hi> and then gave order to burne the City. The Ambaſſadours requeſted him, to ſpare the Church onely, for which he had receaved a ſufficient ranſome. This he granted, and commanded to ſet fire to all the reſt; for which leaving ſome few, he retired to his camp. God had foreſhewn a while before this calamitie to this city. The Enſignes of the Cohorts reſiding there, ſtanding to the Weſt-ward, of themſelves turned to the Eaſt, and then returned where they were before, none touching them. This the Souldiers ſhewed, among many others,<note n="*" place="margin">This Officer he calls before Praefect of the Camp.</note> to the Pourveyor of the expence of the army, one <hi>Tatianus,</hi> born at <hi>Mopſueſtia</hi> in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> a diſcreet man. They ſeeing the prodigie, knew not then how the dominion of the city would be transfer'd from the <hi>Weſtern</hi> to the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Emperour, that being appointed to ſuffer what fell out, they might have no means to avoid it. I am aſtoniſhed, recording for ages to come this great calamitie, and comprehending what ſhould be the will of God, highly thus to exalt ſome man or place, and then upon no reaſon appearing, to ruine them. It is not lawfull to ſay, but that all things by him are done with reaſon; who yet endured <hi>Antioch</hi> to be laid
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50471:30"/>flat with the ground by a moſt impious man; whoſe beauty and magnificence could not even then be wholy concealed. The <hi>Church</hi> onely eſcaped this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, by the <hi>Perſians</hi> care, who had the charge of it; Many houſes alſo were ſaved in the <hi>Cerataeum,</hi> not by any mans care; but ſtanding in the furtheſt end of the city, not joyning to other buildings, the fire reacht them not. They burnt alſo all without the walls, but the Church of <hi>Saint Julian,</hi> and the houſes about it, where the Ambaſſadours lodged. And the city-walls they wholly forbore. The Ambaſſadors came againe alſo to <hi>Choſroes,</hi> and ſaid thus. <hi>If we did not, Sir! ſpeak to your ſelf preſent, we ſhould not believe, that</hi> Choſroes <hi>the ſon of</hi> Cabades <hi>were entred the</hi> Roman <hi>Territories in armes, deſpiſing his Oath ſo lately ſworn, (the ſtrongeſt pawn of faith among men) and breaking Truce, the onely hope left in the calamities of warr. Certainly this courſe is to tranſlate the life of men to that of beaſts. Without Truces muſt be perpetuall warr, which will baniſh thoſe from nature who uſe it. You wrote lately to your brother, that he is guiltie of breaking the Truce: confeſſing thereby, that Truce-breaking is a foule miſchief. If the fault be not his, you do not juſtly to invade us. If he have done ſome ſuch thing, yet purſue your action no further, and appeare the better man. He that hath the worſt in the ill, ought to overcome in the better. But we know the Emperour hath not tranſgreſt the peace; and we entreat you not to act thoſe miſchiefs upon us, which the</hi> Perſians <hi>will never enjoy: and you will gaine nothing, but the fortune of doing deſperate injuries to the</hi> Romans, <hi>with whom you lately made Truce.</hi> But <hi>Choſroes</hi> proteſted, <hi>Juſtinian</hi> to have broken the Truce, and recited particulars, ſome materiall, others ſlight, or counterfeited. Eſpecially he offered to ſhew the Emperours letters to <hi>Alamundarus;</hi> and the <hi>Hunnes,</hi> the maine cauſes of the warr: but he neither alledged nor ſhewed, that ever any of the <hi>Romans</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded the <hi>Perſians,</hi> or did any hoſtile act. The Ambaſſadors denied ſome things, and in others laid the blame upon <hi>Juſtinians</hi> Miniſters. In concluſion, <hi>Choſroes</hi> demanded money; not onely a preſent ſumme, being to eſtabliſh a peace for ever; (For friendſhips gotten with money, commonly waſt with the money) but a yearely penſion for a firme peace, and for the <hi>Perſians</hi> guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Caſpian Gates,</hi> and no more importuning about <hi>Daras;</hi> for which they ſhall be their perpetuall ſtipendiaries. What! ſaid the Ambaſſadors, would you have the <hi>Romans</hi> pay them a tribute? No! quoth he, but to have the <hi>Perſians</hi> their ſouldiers, giving them pay for their ſervice. You give penſions to the <hi>Hunnes</hi> and <hi>Saracens,</hi> not as they are Tributaries, but to guard your Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories. After much debate, in the end they came to this accord; That <hi>Choſroes</hi> ſhould preſently receave fifty <hi>Centenaries</hi> of gold,<note place="margin">157500. <abbr>l'.</abbr> 15720. <abbr>l'.</abbr> ſterl.</note> and a perpetuall yeerly payment of five more; and ſo do no more miſchief, but receaving ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtages upon this accord to retire with his whole army into his country: whither other Ambaſſadors ſhould be ſent from <hi>Juſtinian</hi> to ſettle a firme peace.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>CHoſroes</hi> then went on to <hi>Seleucia,</hi> a maritime city, about ſixteen miles from <hi>Antioch,</hi> where neither finding nor harming any <hi>Roman,</hi> he waſht onely in the Sea-water, did ſacrifice to the <hi>Sun,</hi> and whom he pleaſed, with a deale of ſuperſtition, and rode back againe. Being come to his camp, he deſired much, (as he ſaid, onely for curioſity) to ſee <hi>Apamea,</hi> which ſtood neer. The Ambaſſadours unwillingly yeilded, upon condition, that having ſeen the city, and receaved 1000. <abbr>l'.</abbr> weight in ſilver, he ſhould retire without ſpoiling it. But <hi>Choſroes</hi> appeared to the Ambaſſadors and all men, to take that journey, onely to catch at ſome triviall cauſe to ſack the city, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey about it. Then he went up to <hi>Daphne,</hi> a ſuburbe of <hi>Antioch,</hi> where he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired the Grove and the Fountaines, things worth the ſeeing. Having ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to the <hi>Nymphs,</hi> he came away, doing no miſchief there, but the burning of the Temple of <hi>Michaell</hi> the Archangell, upon this miſtaking. An eminent <hi>Perſian,</hi> well known to the King, rode with ſome in his company by a ragged
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50471:31"/>piece of ground, called <hi>Tretum,</hi> where ſtands the Church of the <hi>Archangell</hi> made by <hi>Evaris;</hi> where finding a young man of <hi>Antioch</hi> hidden, and alone, he quitted his company and chaſed him. The young man was a Butcher, named <hi>Acimachus;</hi> who ready to be caught, turned upon his purſuer ſuddainly, and with a ſtone hit him under the eare into the <hi>dura mater:</hi> and being fallen down, diſpatcht him with his own Cimiter, rifled his armes and apparell, got up on his horſe, and rode cleer away by good chance, or his knowledge of the wayes. <hi>Choſroes</hi> was grieved at the accident, and commanded ſome to burne that Church of the <hi>Archangell;</hi> who thinking he meant this in <hi>Daphne,</hi> burn it with the buildings about it.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Choſroes</hi> with his army went to <hi>Apamea:</hi> where is a piece of wood of a cubit long, part of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Croſs, brought thither long agoe by a <hi>Syrian.</hi> This the Inhabitants believing to be a great defence to them and their city, have put it in a casket ſet all with gold and precious ſtones, and committed it to three Prieſts to keep; and one day yearely the whole city brings it out, and adores it. The <hi>Apameans</hi> were affraid of the <hi>Perſians</hi> coming, hearing too, how in <hi>Choſroes</hi> was no truth: and they entreated their Biſhop <hi>Thomas,</hi> to ſhew them the wood of the Croſs that they might doe it their laſt worſhip: When a miracle happened above reaſon and belief. The Prieſt carrying, and ſhewing the wood, a bright flame hovered above it, and the roofe over it ſhone with an extraordinary light. The Prieſt goeing round the Church, the light went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, keeping ſtill the place of the roofe directly over him. The <hi>Apameans</hi> were raviſht with delight at the miracle, at once rejoycing and weeping; and now confident of their preſervation. <hi>Thomas</hi> having gone round about the Church, put up the wood of the Croſs into the casket, and covered it, and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely the ſhining ceaſed. Underſtanding the enemies to be neer, he went to <hi>Choſroes;</hi> who asking him if the <hi>Apameans</hi> meant to oppoſe his army, he anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered, they had no ſuch thought. <hi>Then open your gates</hi> (<hi>quoth</hi> Choſroes) <hi>and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave me into your city with ſome few. I am come (replied the Biſhop) for the ſame purpoſe to invite you.</hi> So the Army pitcht their tents by the walls, and <hi>Choſroes</hi> with two hundred of his beſt men rode into the city. And no ſooner in, but he forgot his promiſe to the Ambaſſadors, commanding the Biſhop to give him not 1000 <abbr>l.</abbr> weight of ſilver onely, nor ter fold that; but all their treaſures of gold and ſilver, being very great. I doubt not, but without ſcruple he had ſackt, enſlaved the whole city, if God had not manifeſtly hindred him: So did covetouſneſs and vaine glory beſot him; For to lead cities into captivity he eſteemed it a great renown; and thought it nothing to uſe the <hi>Romans</hi> thus, contrary to accords and truces. This humour of his appeares by his attempt upon <hi>Daras,</hi> and the <hi>Callinicians</hi> during the truce, which I ſhall relate hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But God, as I ſaid, preſerved the <hi>Apameans.</hi> When <hi>Choſroes</hi> had taken their treaſures, and <hi>Thomas</hi> ſaw him drunk with aboundance, he brought the wood of the Croſs, and opening the casket, ſhewed it him, ſaying; <hi>O Excellent King! This is all I have left; This casket beautified with gold and precious ſtones, I envy not unto you: Take it with all the reſt. But this piece of wood is to us both preſervative, and precious. I beg, and entreat you Sir to give it me.</hi> Which <hi>Choſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes</hi> granted. Then to ſhew magnificence, he willed the people to goe to the <hi>Circus;</hi> and the <hi>Charioters</hi> to run their matches; and himſelfe was an earneſt beholder of their ſports. But hearing how <hi>Justinian</hi> was long addicted to the <hi>Veneti,</hi> meaning to be contrary to him in that alſo, he would procure the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory for the <hi>Praſini.</hi> The Charioters from the ſtarting place ſet out; and one that wore the <hi>Blew,</hi> got the ſtart, another wearing <hi>Green,</hi> following cloſe at the others wheels. <hi>Choſroes</hi> ſuppoſing it done purpoſely, chafed, and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, That <hi>Caeſar</hi> was foremoſt; which ſhould not be; commanding the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Chariot to ſtay, and ſo caſt behind, to get afore againe if it could. His command being fulfilled, his ſide, the <hi>Praſini</hi> won the match. There an <hi>Apa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean</hi> came, and complained to him of a <hi>Perſian,</hi> for entring his houſe, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing his daughter a virgin. He in a great rage, commanded the man to be produced, and crucified in the campe; But the people clamour'd to him, and beg'd to ſpare the man. <hi>Choſroes</hi> promiſed to pardon him, but ſhortly after
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50471:31"/>ſecretly crucified him; and theſe things done, rode back with his army.</p>
               <p>And at <hi>Chalcis,</hi> diſtant ten miles and a half from <hi>Berrhoea,</hi> He forgot the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord againe; encamped before the city, and ſent <hi>Paul</hi> the interpreter, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to force their city, unleſs they buy their ſafety, ranſome themſelves, and deliver him the Souldiers in their town with their Commander. The <hi>Chalci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> feared both the Emperours, and ſwore they had no ſouldiers; hiding moſt of them, and <hi>Adonachus</hi> their Captaine, in poore cottages from the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; And getting up hardly * two <hi>Centenaries</hi> of gold,<note place="margin">6300 <abbr>l'.</abbr> ſterl.</note> (their city being not rich) with it they ranſomed their bodies and city. From hence <hi>Choſroes</hi> meant to make his retreat, not by the way he came, but to croſs the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and plunder <hi>Meſopotamia.</hi> Neer <hi>Obbane,</hi> which ſtands five miles from the caſtle of <hi>Barbaliſſus,</hi> he made a bridge, and went over, ſignifying to the army to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and that the third day by ſuch an houre, he would take up the bridge; and ſome of them chancing to be caſt behind, at the houre, he not regarding them, ſent to take up the bridge, and they got home as they could.</p>

                  <hi>CHoſroes</hi> was then ambitious to take <hi>Edeſſa;</hi> induced by a confident tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition among the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> (which troubled him) that it was never to be taken; affirmed upon this ground. <hi>Augarus,</hi> long agoe <hi>Toparch</hi> of <hi>Edeſſa</hi> (ſo they then called their nationall Kings) was one of the wiſeſt men of his time, and for that cauſe in much ſavour with the Emperour <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> Deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be a <hi>Roman</hi> Confederat, he went to <hi>Rome;</hi> and conferring with <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus,</hi> ſo amazed him with his wit, and inamour'd him with his converſation, that he would not part with him, though he urged his diſmiſſion. At laſt, after long abſence, longing to returne to his country, but not perſuading <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi> to let him goe; he uſed this deviſe. He went out neer <hi>Rome</hi> to hunt (being therein ſtudious) and compaſſing much country, took many wild beaſts alive, and from every countrey where he caught them, carried of the earth home with him to <hi>Rome,</hi> together with the beaſt. <hi>Auguſtus</hi> ſitting in the <hi>Circus</hi> (as his manner was) <hi>Augarus</hi> came to him, and ſhewed him the beaſts, and the earth, and which country earth belong'd to every beaſt. The earth he cauſed to be laid in ſeverall parts of the <hi>Circus,</hi> and the beaſts from one place to be let goe: When every beaſt leaving one another, ran to the country earth from whence he was taken. <hi>Auguſtus</hi> beheld it long and earneſtly, wondring to ſee nature untaught make even to beaſts deſirable their native earth. Then <hi>Auga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> ſuddainly taking him by the knees, ſaid, <hi>O Sir! And what mind doe you think I have, who have wife and children, and a Kingdom (though a ſmall one) in mine own countrey?</hi> Auguſtus overcome, and forced with the truth, diſmiſſed him, though unwillingly; and bad him ask him ſome thing. <hi>Augarus</hi> prayed him to build a <hi>Circus</hi> at <hi>Edeſſa;</hi> which being granted him, and he diſmiſſed, he came home. His Subjects askt him; what good he had brought them from the Emperour <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> He anſwered, <hi>That he had brought a Grief without damage, and a joy without gaine;</hi> intimating the fortune of the Horſe-races. <hi>Augarus</hi> growing old, and vexed with a grievous gout, and the paine, and ſitting ſtill troubling him, he conſulted with the skillfulleſt Phyſicians from all lands; but finding no eaſe, he forſook them, and abſolutely deſpairing, bewayled his fortune. At that time <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the Son of God, converſed in the body with the people of <hi>Paleſtine;</hi> by committing no ſin, and by working miracles, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting himſelf indeed the Son of God. He raiſed dead men, as from ſleep; to men born blind he opened their eyes, cleanſed leprous bodyes, lame feet he ſet looſe, and did what ever Phyſicians pronounce incurable. <hi>Augarus</hi> hearing the relation from ſome <hi>Paleſtinians,</hi> reſiding at <hi>Edeſſa,</hi> took comfort, and wrote to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> to leave <hi>Jury,</hi> and thoſe ungratefull men, and to live with him. <hi>Chriſt</hi> wrote back againe to <hi>Augarus,</hi> refuſing to come, but promiſing health by his Letter. They ſay he added this, That the city ſhould never be conquered by the <hi>Barbarians.</hi> This Poſtſcript, the writers of the hiſtory of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50471:32"/>that time knew not of; but the <hi>Edeſſenians</hi> affirme to have found it with the Epiſtle; which Epiſtle they have hung for a defence, engraven upon their city gates. But ſhortly after it came under the <hi>Perſian,</hi> not forced, but thus. <hi>Augarus</hi> upon the letter from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> grew well, and having lived long, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed. But his ſon ſucceeding him, being the ungodlyeſt man living, wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſubjects; for which fearing the <hi>Romans</hi> chaſtiſement, he revolted to the <hi>Perſians.</hi> But long afterwards the <hi>Edeſſenians</hi> killed the <hi>Barbarian</hi> Garriſon, and yeilded their city to the <hi>Romans.</hi> Which <hi>Choſroes</hi> knowing, ſtudies to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the city: and this I gueſs by things happened in my time, which ſhall be related in their ſeaſons. And I have had a conceit, that if <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not write that Poſtſcript, yet (men having that opinion) he would keep the city from taking; that he might give them no excuſe of wandring.</p>
               <p>But upon this ground <hi>Choſroes</hi> much affected the taking of <hi>Edeſſa.</hi> At <hi>Batne,</hi> a little Town three dayes journey from <hi>Edeſſa,</hi> he lodged his army; and by break of day was marching toward <hi>Edeſſa.</hi> But they went out of their way ſo, that the next night they lodged in the ſame place: and this happened twice: And when with much adoe he was gotten to <hi>Edeſſa,</hi> they ſay, his chopps ſwell'd with Rhewme; which ſo troubled him, that he reſolved not to attempt the city.

               <p>THen came letters from <hi>Juſtinian</hi> to <hi>Choſroes,</hi> agreeing to ratifie the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie between him and the Ambaſſadours; upon which he diſcharged the Hoſtages, and prepared for his retreat; being pleaſed to ranſome the <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chian</hi> captives: the <hi>Edeſſenians</hi> therein ſhewed an incredible alacrity. Not a man, but according to his ability brought the ranſomes into the Church, and ſome above ability. <hi>Courtiſans</hi> threw in their Jewells, and the husbandman, wanting money or houſeholdſtuffe, brought his aſſe or poore ewe to the Church, that a great quantity was gathered of gold and ſilver, and other goods; but none of it was given for the ranſome. <hi>Buzes</hi> being there, prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited the ranſoming, expecting ſome great gaine out of it. So <hi>Choſroes</hi> with the captives marcht on. The <hi>Carrenians</hi> met him, and offered him a great ſumme, but being no <hi>Chriſtians</hi> but <hi>Heathens,</hi> he would not take it. But of the <hi>Conſtantinians</hi> he took their monie, yet claimed the city to be his from his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors. For <hi>Cabades</hi> having taken <hi>Amida,</hi> would have alſo gotten <hi>Edeſſa,</hi> and <hi>Conſtantina.</hi> And being before <hi>Edeſſa,</hi> he demanded of the <hi>Magi,</hi> if it were to be wonne, pointing with his right hand to the place. They told him, no. For by ſtretching his right hand to it, he gave a ſymbole, not of taking, or of hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the city, but of preſervation. He was ſatisfied with this, and led his army againſt <hi>Conſtantina,</hi> and encamped, with purpoſe to beſiege the town. <hi>Barado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> then Biſhop of the city (an upright godly man, mighty with God in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, whoſe very countenance ſhewed him to be indeed gracious with God) came to <hi>Cabades</hi> with a preſent of wine, dry <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hereupon <hi>Choſroes</hi> claimed the city to belong to him from his Father.</p>
               <p>Being come to <hi>Daras,</hi> he ſate down before it. Within, the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the Generall <hi>Martinus</hi> prepared for their defence. The city hath two walls, the innermoſt large and faire, and ſixty foot high, with turrets; all one hundred foot high: The outward wall is much leſſe, but ſtrong and of good importance. The ground between is about fifty foot broad; where, upon the approach of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50471:32"/>an enemy, the <hi>Darenians</hi> put their cattle. At firſt <hi>Choſroes</hi> with multitude of arrows forced upon the walls to the Weſt-ward, and ſet fire to the gates of the leſſer wall; but none durſt enter. Then he wrought a Mine cloſely on the Eaſt-ſide of the town, the reſt of it being built upon a rock. The <hi>Perſians</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from the town ditch, being very deep, were neither ſeen, nor at all diſcovered by the enemy. And now they were under the foundation of the outter wall, and in the ground between the walls, and ſhortly to paſs the great wall, and take the town; when from the camp of <hi>Choſroes,</hi> about noon, came a man (or more than a man) all alone to the wall, ſeeming to gather up the ſcattered arrows; and withall warding with his ſhield, to flout thoſe upon the battlements. Then diſcovering the buſineſſe, he bade them watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully provide for their ſafety, and went his way. The <hi>Romans</hi> immediately dig'd for life in the ground between the walls; which the <hi>Perſians</hi> not diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, went on with their work, in a ſtreight line to the wall; and the <hi>Romans,</hi> by the adviſe of <hi>Theodorus,</hi> a famous Ingineer, traverſed with their Mine very deep, that in the end the <hi>Perſians</hi> in the ground between the walls, fell ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly into the <hi>Romans</hi> croſs Mine; who killed the firſt comers, but the reſt eſcaped to the camp. The <hi>Romans</hi> would not purſue them in the dark. <hi>Choſroes</hi> failing in this, and ſeeing no hope of taking the town, capitulated for a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pound weight of ſilver, which he had from the beſieged, and went home. <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> for this attempt of <hi>Choſroes</hi> upon <hi>Daras,</hi> during the truce, refuſed to ratifie the Treaty. And this was the ſucceſſe of <hi>Choſroes</hi> firſt Invaſion, and ſo the ſummer ended.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Aſſyria</hi> he built a City a dayes journey from <hi>Cteſiphon,</hi> and named it <hi>Antioch</hi> of <hi>Choſroes,</hi> planting there the <hi>Antiochian</hi> captives. He built them a publique Bath, and a <hi>Circus,</hi> and fitted it for other delights; bringing from <hi>Antioch,</hi> and other <hi>Roman</hi> Cities, Charioters, and skilfull Muſicians. He kept theſe <hi>Antiochians</hi> at the publique charge, not like captives; and term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them <hi>Baſilici,</hi> as exempt from all Magiſtrates but the King. If a <hi>Roman</hi> captive ranne from his Maſter, and fled to this <hi>Antioch</hi> of <hi>Choſroes,</hi> being there avowed by an inhabitant for his Kinſman, he might not be led away by his maſter, though a very principall <hi>Perſian.</hi> The Prodigy which befell the <hi>Antiochians</hi> in the reign of <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> was now conſummated. A ſtrong wind then, and a ſuddain, blew up by the rootes, the goodly tall <hi>Cypreſſes</hi> in <hi>Daphne,</hi> the ſuburb of <hi>Antioch;</hi> it being not lawfull to cut them. Shortly after this prodigy, in the reign of <hi>Juſtine,</hi> an Earthquake ſhook the City ſo, that it overthrew moſt of the buildings, and deſtroyed three hundred thouſand men. But in this laſt deſtruction the City, as I have related, was even ruined.</p>
               <p>And now <hi>Beliſarius</hi> the Emperour ſent for to <hi>Conſtaentinople;</hi> where having wintred, at the beginning of the ſpring he ſent him Generall againſt <hi>Choſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes;</hi> with the Commanders who came with him out of <hi>Italy.</hi>

                  </note> upon this ground invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the <hi>Lazians.</hi> The <hi>Lazians</hi> firſt inhabited <hi>Cholchis,</hi> and were ſubject to the <hi>Romans;</hi> not to payment of tribute: Onely upon deceaſe of their King,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50471:33"/>the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour ſent to the Succeſſor the Enſignes of Majeſty; and they guarded the marches of their country; that the <hi>Hunnes</hi> might not by Mount <hi>Caucaſus</hi> (which borders with them) paſſe through <hi>Lazica,</hi> and invade the <hi>Romans.</hi> Neither for this received they money, nor army from the <hi>Romans,</hi> nor ſerved in their wars; only they trafficked in Merchandiſe with the <hi>Romans</hi> of <hi>Pontus;</hi> bartring skins, hides, and ſlaves for corn, ſalt, and other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities they want. But upon the accident formerly recited by me, to <hi>Gur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> King of <hi>Iberia,</hi> ſome <hi>Roman</hi> forces were lodged in <hi>Lazica;</hi> with whom the <hi>Barbarians</hi> were diſcontented, and chiefly with <hi>Peter</hi> the General, a man naturally miſcheivous. He was born in <hi>Arzanéne,</hi> a country beyond the river of <hi>Nymphius,</hi> ſubject to the <hi>Perſians.</hi> Being a child, he was taken captive by <hi>Juſtine,</hi> invading <hi>Perſia</hi> with <hi>Celers</hi> army after the taking of <hi>Amida;</hi> who uſed much humanity to him, and ſent him to a Grammar ſchool. Then was he Scribe to <hi>Juſtine;</hi> who comming to the Empire upon the death of <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſius,</hi> made him a Generall, wherein he grew infinitely covetous, and lewd to all men. <hi>Juſtinian</hi> afterward ſent Commanders into <hi>Lazica,</hi> and at laſt <hi>Iohn Tzibus;</hi> a man raiſed from mean condition, and advanced to this Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralſhip, onely for being the wickedeſt of all men, and very ſufficient to find unjuſt revenues. And he ruined and confounded the affairs of the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Lazians.</hi> He perſwaded <hi>Juſtinian</hi> to build a Sea-town in <hi>Lazica,</hi> called <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra:</hi> Where ſitting, as in a Cittadell, he made booty of <hi>Lazica.</hi> He prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Merchants to import Salt, or other proviſions to the <hi>Lazians,</hi> nor to buy ought of them; but ſetting up a Monopoly at <hi>Petra,</hi> himſelf was both retailer, and ſole maſter of the ſayd trade, and ſold to the <hi>Lazians,</hi> not at uſuall prizes, but as he liſt. The people alſo were diſpleaſed at the <hi>Roman</hi> army, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon their country, not formerly uſed; and not enduring it, reſolved to revolt to the <hi>Perſians.</hi> And (unknown to the <hi>Romans</hi>) they ſent Ambaſſadors to negotiate the ſame with <hi>Choſroes,</hi> with inſtructions to take aſſurance from <hi>Choſroes,</hi> not to leave the <hi>Lazians</hi> to the <hi>Romans</hi> without their conſent; and ſo to come home with an army of <hi>Perſians.</hi> Theſe Ambaſſadors in <hi>Perſia</hi> get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing private acceſſe to <hi>Choſroes,</hi> ſpake thus. <q>Great King, if ever fortune did gladly reduce men revolted fooliſhly from their friends to ſtrangers, ſuch think us the <hi>Lazians</hi> to be. We were ancient allyes of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and did, and received many good turns; the monuments whereof remaine to this day, both among our Records, and in your royall Palace. But in ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing times, our anceſtors either neglected by you, or upon ſome other ground, entred into league with the <hi>Romans.</hi> And now both we and our King preſent to the <hi>Perſians</hi> our ſelves and country, praying you to conſider of us thus. If upon no hard meaſure from the <hi>Romans,</hi> but of meer ill nature, we come to you, reject us, as not likely to be faithfull to you. The manner of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing friendſhip, is a detection of that made with others. But being to the <hi>Romans</hi> friends in words onely, but in effect truſty ſlaves, and ſuffering moſt unrighteous tyranny; receive us for your ſervants, formerly your friends; deteſt a bitter tyranny riſen ſo near you; and doe things worthy the juſtice naturall to the <hi>Perſians.</hi> He is not juſt who does no wrong himſelf, if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcue not men oppreſſed by others, being able. To ſpeak ſome of the things practiſed by theſe accurſed <hi>Romans:</hi> To our King they have left the only out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of Royalty, themſelves have uſurped the authority. The King, in the condition of a miniſter, ſtands in aw of a Generall directing him. They have laid an army upon us, not to guard our country (for none moleſt us but themſelves) but to lock us up in priſon, while themſelves are maſters of what is ours. Nay, ſee Sir! a more expedite deviſe of theirs to rob us. Their own ſuperfluities they compell us to buy, and they buy what <hi>Lazica</hi> affords for their uſe; but ſo, as the price in both is ſet down as our conquerours pleaſe. And thus they rob us of our neceſſary commodities, and our mony too; under the ſpecious name of Trade, being indeed a meer oppreſſion. Over us is a Governour, a retailer, with his authority making a trade upon our wants. This being the cauſe of our revolt, it hath the juſtice of it in it ſelf. But as to the commodity reſulting to you by accepting the <hi>Lazians;</hi>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:50471:33"/>you ſhall add unto the <hi>Perſian</hi> Empire an ancient Kingdom, and therein en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large your glory. Then ſhall you by our Countrey have the conveniencie of uſing to <hi>Roman</hi> Seas. Wherein building ſhipps, the very Palace of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> will be acceſſible unto you, with eaſe, nothing being between to ſtop you. Adde alſo, that it will be in your power, for the bordering <hi>Barbarians</hi> to ſpoile the <hi>Romans</hi> every yeare, <hi>Lazica,</hi> (as you know) being now their on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rampier againſt the mountaines of <hi>Caucaſus.</hi> So that right leading, and profit following, not to admit our propoſition, is certainely no good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell. <hi>Choſroes</hi> was pleaſed with this diſcourſe, and agreed to aide the <hi>Lazians:</hi>
                  </q> Demanding of the Ambaſſadors, if it were poſſible for a great army to march into <hi>Lazica,</hi> which he heard to be ſcarce paſſable for a traveller, being moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous, and for a long way entangled with thick woods. They told him that by cutting the trees, and throwing them into the ill paſſages, there would be eaſie way for his whole army; and they promiſed to be his guides, and to work in the head of the army. <hi>Choſroes</hi> encouraged herewith, gathered a great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and prepared for the voyage, not diſcovering his intent, but to his moſt ſecret Counſellors, and charging the Ambaſſadors not to reveale their nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation. His pretence was, a journey into <hi>Iberia,</hi> to ſettle things there; where a nation of <hi>Hunnes</hi> was reported to invade the <hi>Perſian</hi> dominion.</p>
               <p>In the meane time <hi>Beliſarius</hi> gather'd together the army in <hi>Meſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potamia,</hi> and ſent ſome into <hi>Perſia</hi> to diſcover; intending to encounter the enemy there, if he invade againe; and he muſtred, and furniſhed his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; being naked, and unarm'd, and afraid of the name of a <hi>Perſian.</hi> The eſpialls returning aſſured him, there would bee no invaſion; <hi>Choſroes</hi> being engaged in a warr with the <hi>Hunnes. Beliſarius</hi> upon this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to enter the enemies land with his army. <hi>Arethas</hi> came up to him with an army of <hi>Saracens;</hi> And the Emperour wrote to him to invade the enemies countrey immediately. So that calling to him the Commanders at <hi>Daras,</hi> he 'ſpake thus. <hi>Fellow Commanders! I know you experienced in many warrs; and I call you not now, by remembrances or exhortations to provoke your reſolution againſt the enemy (I doe not thinck you need diſcourſes to make you valiant); but that by conſulting we may chuſe the beſt for the</hi> Emperours <hi>affaires. For the warr, more then any thing affects the directions of good counſell: And thoſe who counſell, muſt be free from awe and feare. For feare amazing, ſuffers not the judgement to make choice of the beſt things: And awe clouding better determinations, carries the judgement com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to the worſe. If therefore the</hi> Emperour <hi>or my ſelf, be thought to have made any reſolution already, believe it not. For he being farr diſtant from the affaires, cannot fit proceedings to new occaſions; and ſo there is no feare; if by croſſing him, you effect what is moſt expedient for his affaires. And me, being but a man, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long time come from the</hi> Weſt, <hi>ſomething cannot but paſſe unſeen. So that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtanding in awe of my opinion, you are to ſpeak boldly what is beſt for your ſelves and the</hi> Emperour. <hi>At firſt, we came hither to reſtraine the enemy from invading our countrey. But now, things ſucceeding above our hopes, we may conſult concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his countrey. For which purpoſe being now aſſembled, it is fit for every man to ſpeak freely, what he holds moſt expedient. Beliſarius</hi> ſpake thus; and <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Buzes</hi> bad lead on the army without delay into the enemies countrey, whoſe vote all the Aſſembly followed. <hi>Requithancus</hi> and <hi>Theoctiſtus,</hi> commanders of the forces in <hi>Phoenicia Libani,</hi> ſaid, they approved the invaſion alſo, but feared in their abſence, <hi>Alamundarus</hi> would forrage <hi>Phoenicia</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> and that the <hi>Emperour</hi> might be offended for their not guarding the country under their charge: So they refuſed to accompany the army. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> ſaid, they imagined that which was not; For being now Summer, two moneths of this ſeaſon the <hi>Saracens</hi> conſecrate to their God, and make no inroads. And ſo promiſing to diſmiſſe them, and their troopes within two moneths, he commanded them to goe along, and with much diligence prepared for the Invaſion.</p>

                  </gap> which they found thick and entangled, and threw them into the ſteep and ragged wayes, and ſo paſt eaſily, none encountring them. When they were come into the midſt of <hi>Lazica</hi> (where the Poets fain to have been acted the fortunes of <hi>Jaſon</hi> and <hi>Medea</hi>) <hi>Gubazes,</hi> King of the <hi>Lazians,</hi> came and adored <hi>Choſroes</hi> as his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; rendring himſelf with his Royall Palaces, and all <hi>Lazica. Petra</hi> ſtands in <hi>Lazica</hi> upon the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea, formerly a meane town, but by <hi>Juſtinian</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with walls, and other ornaments, and made a ſtrong famous place. <hi>Choſroes</hi> underſtanding the <hi>Roman</hi> Forces with <hi>John Tzibus</hi> to be there, ſent an army, and <hi>Aniavedes</hi> Generall thereof, to ſurprize it. But <hi>John</hi> knowing their coming, directed no man to ſally, nor to be ſeen upon the battlements; and he placed his forces in armes, cloſe to the gates, commanding them not to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the leaſt ſound or voice. The <hi>Perſian</hi> being come before the walls, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no man, ſuppoſed the city waſt, and abandoned by the enemy. So he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach't to ſet up ſcaling ladders, expecting none to defend, becauſe he ſaw nor heard no enemy, and he ſent to <hi>Choſroes,</hi> to let him know, what they found. He ſending the moſt of his army, commanded a generall aſſault, and one of the Commanders to make uſe of the <hi>Ramme</hi> neer the gates, and from the neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt hill to the city himſelf was a ſpectator of the buſineſs. When ſuddainly the <hi>Romans</hi> opened the gates, and falling upon the enemy unaware, killed moſt of them, ſpecially thoſe about the <hi>Ramme;</hi> The reſt with their Generall ran away and eſcaped. <hi>Choſroës</hi> in anger crucified <hi>Aniavedes,</hi> for being over-ſtragem'd by <hi>John,</hi> a retailer, and no ſouldier. Some ſay he crucified, not <hi>Aniavedes,</hi> but the commander who attended the <hi>Ramme.</hi> Then himſelf with his whole army encamped before the town; and perceaving upon view the fortifications not very tenable, he brought on his forces, commanding to ſhoot at the battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The <hi>Romans</hi> defending with their engines, and ſhot, at firſt the <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> (though they ſhot thick) hurt little; but ſuffred much, being ſhot from high. Afterward (for <hi>Petra</hi> was to be taken by <hi>Choſroës</hi>) <hi>John,</hi> being ſhot into the neck, died. Then the <hi>Romans</hi> became careleſs; and it growing dark the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians</hi> retired. The next day, they drew a mine to the town: which for ſteepe rocks about it, is not acceſſible, nor yet to the ſea-ward; but by one narrow entrance only upon plaine ground, with high clifts on each ſide. There the builders of the city foreſeeing the walls eaſie to be forced, made from each clift a long wall, a croſſe the entrance, and at each end two turrets, wrought with great ſtones, not hollow in the middle, but whole from the ground, and very high, and the ſtones ſo joyned, as not to be ſhaken with <hi>Ramme</hi> or other engine. The <hi>Perſians</hi> cloſely with their mine, were come under one of theſe turrets; whence carrying out the ſtones, they ſet up tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and put fire to them. Which encreaſing by degrees, crumbled and brake the firme eſs of the ſtones, and ſo looſening the Turret, down it came ſuddain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The <hi>Romans</hi> in it perceaved it juſt ſo much before, as not to fall with the Turret, and to get within the city walls. Then the Enemy could eaſily force their entrance upon even ground. But the <hi>Romans</hi> affrighted, came to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and receaving <hi>Choſroës</hi> oath, for their perſons, and goods, yeilded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and the city by compoſition. <hi>Choſroes</hi> finding in <hi>Petra</hi> much wealth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to <hi>John,</hi> took it; but of any other, himſelf nor the <hi>Perſians</hi> toucht nothing; And the <hi>Romans,</hi> having every man his own, mingled with the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> army.</p>

                  <hi>BEliſarius</hi> heard nothing from theſe parts; but marcht with the army toward <hi>Niſibis;</hi> and being half way thither kept his right hand way, where
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50471:34"/>were ſtore of ſprings, and a ſpacious champian to encampe. But ſome had no mind to goe on, ſo that <hi>Beliſarius</hi> made this ſpeech to the Commanders. <q>I did not mean to publiſh my determination: For a word vented in a camp ſpreds at laſt even to the enemy. But I ſee every man will be an abſolute Commander; therefore I ſhall impart, what I thought to conceale; with this preamble, that when in an army many will be abſolute, nothing can be well done. Certainly <hi>Choſroes</hi> invading others, hath not left his own country without guard, eſpecially this City, being the firſt therof and a rampire to the reſt; wherein, I know, he hath lodged a garriſon ſo ſtrong, and of ſo good men, as will be able to oppoſe our aſſaults.

Beliſarius</hi> put in order of battail the troupes with himſelf, and ſent direction to <hi>Peter</hi> to ſtand in readineſſe till he gave the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and to obſerve at noon, that the <hi>Barbarians</hi> will ſally, becauſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves dine in the evening, and the <hi>Romans</hi> at noon. But <hi>Peters</hi> men ſlighted his commands, and being faint with the ſunne (for that city is extremely hot) layd down their arms, and diſorderly fell to gather figs, without apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of an enemy. Which <hi>Nabedes</hi> obſerving, gallopt up to them with his army. They ſeeing them iſſue out of the gates (being in an open champian) ſent to <hi>Beliſarius</hi> to ſuccour them; and themſelves tumultuouſly, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion encountred. <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> before the meſſenger came, ſaw the enemies mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the duſt raiſed, and with his troupes rode amain to their ſuccour. But in the mean time the <hi>Perſians</hi> charged them; which they not enduring, ran away. The enemy purſuing took <hi>Peters</hi> Enſign, and ſlew fifty of them. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they had dyed every man, if <hi>Beliſarius</hi> had not received them into his troups, much diſtreſſed. Where firſt the <hi>Goths</hi> preſenting their long thick Lances, the <hi>Perſians</hi> ſtood them not, but fell to running, and the <hi>Romans,</hi> and <hi>Goths</hi> purſuing killed a hundred &amp; fifty of them. The chaſe was not long. So the enemy got within their walls, and the <hi>Romans</hi> returned to their camp. The next day the <hi>Perſians</hi> ſet the Enſign of <hi>Peter</hi> for a trophy, upon one of the turrets; and laught and brag'd, but durſt ſally no more out of their forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beliſarius</hi> conſidering <hi>Niſibis</hi> ſtrongly ſcituated, and having no hope to take it, urged to riſe thence, and to march, where they might ſuddainly ſpoyl the enemy. So after a dayes march he came to a caſtle of the <hi>Perſians</hi> called <hi>Siſibranum,</hi> full of inhabitants, and eight hundred of the beſt <hi>Perſian</hi> horſmen to guard it; commanded by <hi>Blechames,</hi> a principal man. The <hi>Romans</hi> encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before the Caſtle, and aſſaulting were repulſed with loſſe of many; the walls being ſtrong, and the <hi>Barbarians</hi> oppoſing obſtinately. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> then called his fellow Commanders, and told them; <q>How experience of many wars taught them to foreſee the event in actions doubtful, and before diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſters to chuſe the better way. That they knew their diſadvantage now, marching in an enemies country, full of ſtrong Garriſons. If they goe on, it is likely that from <hi>Niſibis</hi> the enemy will follow them, and infeſt them with ambuſhes. And if another army meet them, they will be forced to a battail with both, and may be undone. Then if they be routed, they have no means of retreat into <hi>Roman</hi> land. They ſhould not therefore cruſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with inconſiderate induſtry, nor with ambition to winne, hurt the <hi>Roman</hi> affairs. An ignorant daring brings to deſtruction, and a ſober de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50471:35"/>laying preſerves men. That themſelves therefore ſhould ſit down before the Caſtle, and that <hi>Arethas</hi> with his <hi>Saracens</hi> (men unapt for aſſaults, but excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent plunderers) ſhould enter <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and with them ſome of their beſt ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. Theſe, if no oppoſition appear, to take the ſpoyl; and (the enemy op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing) to retire to this army: Which if it take the Caſtle, may paſſe the <hi>Tigris,</hi> fearing no miſchief behind, and informed in what ſtate the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> are.</q> They all approved this adviſe of <hi>Beliſarius:</hi> Who accordingly commanded <hi>Arethas</hi> to go againſt the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> and ſent with him 1200 ſouldiers, moſt of his own Targettiers, commanded by two of his Lanciers, <hi>Trajanus</hi> and <hi>John</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Phagas,</hi> and directed to be obedient to <hi>Arethas,</hi> whom he inſtructed to forrage the countries, and coming back to the camp, to report what forces the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> had. Theſe paſt the <hi>Tigris</hi> into <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> found the country rich, and without guard, and ſo ranſackt many towns and got much wealth. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſarius</hi> in the mean time underſtood from <hi>Perſian</hi> priſoners, That the Caſtle (not uſing, as <hi>Daras</hi> and <hi>Niſibis,</hi> to lay in yearly proviſions, and then prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an enemy, and having brought in none, and many ſuddainly reſorting thither for refuge) wanted proviſions. He ſent therefore <hi>George,</hi> a wiſe man, and truſted with his ſecrets, to try if the place might be had by compoſition. Who with his reaſons, and fair words, prevailed with them to take aſſurances for their ſafety, and to render themſelves and the Caſtle to the <hi>Romans. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſarius</hi> did no harm to the Inhabitants, being <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and antiently <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> The <hi>Perſians</hi> with <hi>Blechames</hi> he ſent to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and threw down the walls of the Caſtle. Theſe <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Blechames</hi> the Emperour ſent into <hi>Italy</hi> againſt the <hi>Goths.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Arethas,</hi> fearing the <hi>Romans</hi> might take away his booty, would return no more to the camp. And he commanded ſome ſcoutes ſent out purpoſely by him, to report a great army of enemies to be at the paſſage of the river; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he adviſed <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Trajan</hi> to return ſome other way into the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Territories. So they went not to <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> but keeping the <hi>Euphrates</hi> on their right hand, came to <hi>Theodoſiopolis,</hi> ſtanding upon the river of <hi>Abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras.</hi> The <hi>Roman</hi> army with <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> hearing nothing of theſe forces, were troubled and affraid: And the ſaid ſiege having being long in the <hi>Perſian Meſopotamia,</hi> infinitely hot; the men being not uſed to heats, ſpecially thoſe of <hi>Thrace;</hi> and ſtirring much in them, and lodging in cloſe cabbins in the ſummer, the third part of them lay half dead with Feavers; and all were ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt to be gone home; ſpecially <hi>Requithancus,</hi> and <hi>Theoctiſtus,</hi> Captaines of <hi>Phoenicia Libani.</hi> Who importuned <hi>Beliſarius</hi> (the <hi>Saracens</hi> conſecrated time being paſt) proteſting to ſtay there to no purpoſe, and in the mean time to abandon the towns of <hi>Libanus</hi> and <hi>Syria</hi> to <hi>Alamundarus. Beliſarius</hi> hereupon called a counſell, where <hi>John</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Nicetas</hi> firſt roſe, and ſpake thus; <q>Excellent <hi>Beliſarius!</hi> I think the world hath not had, neither for time nor va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, a Captain like your ſelf. This opinion prevailes not onely with <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> but with all <hi>Barbarians.</hi> And certainly hereby you will preſerve this glory firm, if you bring us alive into the <hi>Roman</hi> dominions; as we now are, our expectations are not fair. Our <hi>Saracens,</hi> and beſt men are come over the <hi>Tigris,</hi> and gone into our upper Provinces, ſo faſt, as not to ſend us ſo much as a meſſenger. <hi>Requithancus</hi> and <hi>Theoctistus</hi> will be inſtantly gone; ſuppoſing <hi>Alamundarus</hi> forraging <hi>Phoenicia:</hi> and of the reſt we have more ſick, then ſound men, to bring them into the <hi>Roman</hi> dominions. Such, as if an enemy light on us here, or upon our retreat, not a man will be left to report our diſaſter to the <hi>Romans</hi> at <hi>Daras.</hi> To march up higher, I think it not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in reaſon. Whilſt therefore ſome hope is left, 'tis good counſell to make a faire retreat; and madneſs for men in our danger, not to adviſe upon ſafety, but deſignes on an enemy.</q> All approved this ſpeech of <hi>John;</hi> and cryed out for a ſpeedy retreat. So <hi>Beliſarius</hi> put his ſick into waggons, and led home the army; where he heard what <hi>Arethas</hi> had done, but could have no right of him, being not yet come to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Choſroes</hi> in the mean time, having taken <hi>Petra,</hi> had the newes of <hi>Beliſarius</hi> invaſion; of the battaile by <hi>Niſibis;</hi> the taking of <hi>Siſabranum,</hi> and what the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50471:35"/>forces, which with <hi>Arethas</hi> paſt the <hi>Tigris,</hi> had done. So leaving a Garriſon in <hi>Petra,</hi> he went into <hi>Perſia</hi> with the reſt of his army, and <hi>Roman</hi> captives. Theſe were the occurrents of <hi>Choſroes's</hi> ſecond invaſion; And <hi>Beliſarius</hi> was by the Emperour ſent for to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where he ſpent his Winter.</p>

               <p>IN the beginning of the Spring,<note place="margin">Choſroës <hi>third Invaſion in</hi> An. Dom. 542. &amp; Juſtiniani 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Choſroes</hi> invaded the <hi>Roman</hi> territorie the third time, with a great army; keeping the <hi>Euphrates</hi> to his right hand. <hi>Candidus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Sergiopolis,</hi> having not kept his day with <hi>Choſroes,</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, and came to the <hi>Perſian</hi> Camp; where he beſought <hi>Choſroes</hi> not to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with him; That he never had money, nor ever thought of ranſoming the <hi>Surenians</hi> himſelfe; he had been a ſutor to the Emperour, but got no good. But <hi>Choſroes</hi> put him in priſon, and bitterly tortured him, and bad him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure double the ſumme formerly agreed. He prayed him to ſend to <hi>Sergiopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> to receave the treaſures of the Church; which <hi>Choſroes</hi> did, and <hi>Candidus</hi> ſent ſome with his meſſengers: to whom the <hi>Sergiopolitans</hi> gave many of thoſe treaſures, proteſting to have nothing left. But <hi>Choſroes</hi> ſaid, thoſe ſhould not ſuffice; he muſt have more; and he ſent ſome in pretence to make privy ſearch for their wealth, but indeed to ſurprize the city: But <hi>Sergiopolis</hi> was not then to be taken. For a <hi>Saracen</hi> under <hi>Alamundarus</hi> (being a Chriſtian) named <hi>Ambrus,</hi> came under the wall by night; revealed the plot; and bad them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave no <hi>Perſians</hi> into their town. So <hi>Choſroes</hi> ſeeing his men returne without effect, in a great rage ſent ſix thouſand men to force the town. Who aſſaulted, and the <hi>Sergiopolitans</hi> at firſt defended bravely. But grown weary and affraid, they adviſed to render the city; having but two hundred Souldiers within. But <hi>Ambrus</hi> came againe by night, and told them that within two dayes the <hi>Perſians</hi> would raiſe their ſiege; their water abſolutely failing. Whereupon they refuſed to parly; and the enemy afflicted with third, roſe, and returned to <hi>Choſroes.</hi> Who would not diſmiſs <hi>Candidus:</hi> It behoved, I think, that having broke his oath, he ſhould no more be a Prieſt.</p>
               <p>But when <hi>Choſroes</hi> came into <hi>Comagena,</hi> called <hi>Euphrateſia,</hi> he would not forrage, nor take townes, as having ſpoiled all in <hi>Syria</hi> formerly in his way, and either ſackt or ranſom'd them, as hath been ſaid. But his intent was to march directly into <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> and there to take the ſpoile, eſpecially of the Treaſures at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> hearing the Province was fertile, and richly inhabited. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> both Commanders and Souldiers had no mind to meet the enemy, to ſtay his paſſage; but thought it enough within their fortifications to preſerve them, and themſelves. <hi>Juſtinian</hi> advertiſed of this invaſion, againe ſent <hi>Beliſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius;</hi> who taking Poſt-horſes, arrived with great ſpeed, (having no Souldiers with him) in <hi>Comagena. Juſtus</hi> the Emperors brothers ſon, with <hi>Buzes</hi> and ſome other, were gotten into <hi>Hierapolis;</hi> and hearing <hi>Beliſarius</hi> to be neer, wrote this letter to him. <hi>Choſroes, as your ſelf know, hath againe invaded the</hi> Romans, <hi>with a much greater army then formerly. Whither he intends, he yet makes no ſhew: onely we heare, he is very neer, and hurts no town in his way, ſtill marching forward. Come therefore ſpeedily unto us, if poſſibly you can ſlip by the enemy; that you may be preſerved for the Emperour, and guard here</hi> Hierapolis <hi>with us. Beliſarius</hi> liked not this letter, but went to <hi>Europus,</hi> a town upon the <hi>Euphrates;</hi> from whence he ſent, and levyed an army; which encamped there; and to the commanders he returned this anſwer; <hi>If</hi> Choſroes <hi>goe againſt other people, and not</hi> Romans, <hi>you have fallen upon a moſt ſafe counſell. They who by lying ſtill can avoid the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, are madd to run into a needleſs danger. But you being quit of the</hi> Barbarian, <hi>he will fall upon ſome other country, the beſt he can find, and without garriſons; Know then, that a valiant death is better, then ſuch a preſervation, or rather trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Come you therefore ſpeedily to</hi> Europus; <hi>where aſſembling our whole forces, we ſhall effect upon our enemies, what God ſhall grant us.</hi> The Commanders took heart at this letter; and leaving <hi>Juſtus</hi> with ſome to guard <hi>Hierapolis,</hi> the reſt went to <hi>Europus.</hi>

               <p>WHen <hi>Choſroes</hi> heard <hi>Beliſarius</hi> to be at <hi>Europus,</hi> he march't no further; but ſent to him one of his Secretaries, named <hi>Abandanes,</hi> (a very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet man,<note place="margin">This is ſupplied by the Latin Tranſlation.</note>) to complaine; that <hi>Juſtinian</hi> had not ſent his Ambaſſadors to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the treaty. Of whoſe coming <hi>Beliſarius</hi> underſtanding, he choſe ſix thouſand the goodlieſt of his men, as if he would ſend them out to hunt. He commanded alſo <hi>Diogenes,</hi> one of his Lanciers, and <hi>Adolius,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Acacius</hi> and <hi>Armenian</hi> (one of thoſe who attend in the Emperours Palace to keep off noiſe, whom the <hi>Romans</hi> call <hi>Silentarij,</hi> and now Captaine of the forces in <hi>Armenia</hi>) to skirt along the ſhore of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> with a thouſand horſe, and at times to make ſhew to paſſe the river to invade their countrey. Himſelf hearing the Ambaſſador to be at hand, retired to his pavillion, which uſes to be made with boards; that he might ſeeme to the Ambaſſador, to be in a poore town without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions. His ſouldiers he thus diſpoſed. On the one ſide of his pavillion, were the <hi>Thracians,</hi> and <hi>Illyrians;</hi> and behind them the <hi>Goths;</hi> and next the <hi>Heru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians;</hi> then the <hi>Vandales</hi> and <hi>Moores.</hi> They took up much ſpace, not ſtanding ſtill, but walking at diſtance, and looking careleſly, and confidently upon the Ambaſſador. None had his mantle on, but linnen coates like women girt about them, and in their hands a Horſemans-whip. For armes ſome had ſwords, ſome battle axes, others bowes onely; looking like hunters, in all haſt, (omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all) to be purſueing the wild beaſts. <hi>Abandanes</hi> the Ambaſſador, coming to <hi>Beliſarius</hi> ſaid, <hi>That it was a foule indignity, that</hi> Ceſar (<hi>ſo the</hi> Perſians <hi>call the</hi> Roman <hi>Emperour</hi>) <hi>had not ſent Ambaſſadors about the Articles, which had conſtrained his maſter to enter the</hi> Roman <hi>territory in armes. Beliſarius</hi> not fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their great army, and without any trouble in his mind or countenance, ſmiled, and with a cheerfull look anſwered him; <hi>Men doe not cenſure the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of</hi> Choſroes <hi>by the ſame reaſons he does them by: other men demanding ought of their neighbours, ſend Ambaſſadors firſt, and if they get not right, then they make warr. But he being in armes in the heart of our provinces, ſhameleſly now talks of peace.</hi> Having thus ſaid, he diſmiſſed the Ambaſſador. Who coming back to <hi>Choſroes,</hi> perſwaded him to lay down armes, telling him; <hi>That he lighted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a captaine the ſtouteſt, and the wiſeſt in the world, and upon ſuch ſouldiers as he never beheld the like; whoſe order he extreamely admired. Then was the match between them unequall; He overcoming, ſhould onely vanquiſh a ſlave of</hi> Ceſars; <hi>but being overcome, ſhould get infinit diſhonour to him and his houſe. The</hi> Romans <hi>alſo being beaten, may eſcape into their fortreſſes, and in their own countrey. But if other then well happen to his army, there will be no meſſenger left to report the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in</hi> Perſia. <hi>Choſroes</hi> upon theſe reaſons, had a mind to goe home, but was troubled, knowing the paſſages of the river to be guarded by the enemy:<note n="*" place="margin">Here the Greek begins againe.</note> and march the ſame way againe through a wilderneſs he could not, the proviſions they brought with them failing. In concluſion he thought it beſt, though with hazarding a battaile, to get to the land on the other ſide the river, and ſo to march through a plentifull countrey. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> knew well, that not 100000. men could hinder his paſſage; the river being paſſable by boats, and his army ſtronger, then to be barred their way by few enemies. Having alſo, as I ſaid, commanded <hi>Diogenes</hi> and <hi>Adolius</hi> with a conſiderable party to the ſhore, to amaze the enemy with ſuddaineſs, and to put him in diſorder: Now he fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, leaſt by frighting him, he might interrupt his quitting the <hi>Roman</hi> territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; thinking it a matter of much importance, to drive him away, without hazarding with a very ſmall army, heartily affraid of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> againſt ſo many thouſands. Wherefore he bad <hi>Diogenes</hi> and <hi>Adolius</hi> ſtay. And <hi>Choſroes</hi> ſpeedily making a bridge, paſs'd with his army over the <hi>Euphrates.</hi> Which was done with eaſe, the <hi>Perſians</hi> having in their marches, ever ready, great iron hooks, wherewith they faſten long timbers together, and make a bridge ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly. Being upon the other ſide, he ſent to tell <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> that he had grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the <hi>Romans</hi> with his retreate, but expected Ambaſſadors from them imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> alſo paſſed the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and ſent ſome to <hi>Choſroes,</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50471:36"/>him for retiring; to promiſe Ambaſſadors forthwith from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, to finiſh the articles accorded; and to deſire him in his paſſage through the <hi>Roman</hi> ſubjects, to uſe them as friends. Which he promiſed, ſo he might have ſome principall man for hoſtage of performance of what they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> hearing what he ſaid, ſent him from <hi>Edeſſa John,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Baſilius,</hi> an unwilling hoſtage; being the chief man in the city for birth and eſtate. But the <hi>Romans</hi> much extolled <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> who in this action ſeemed to gaine more reputation, then when he brought <hi>Gelimer</hi> and <hi>Vitigis</hi> priſoners to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> The truth is, it deſerved highly to be valued, when the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> were terrified, and hid in their fortreſſes, and <hi>Choſroes</hi> with a mighty ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in the midſt of their country, for a Generall coming poſt from <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> to encamp with a few in the face of <hi>Choſroes;</hi> to ſtop him; and then, either frighting him with his fortune and valour, or deceaving him with art, to make him in effect run away, and in words deſire a peace.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Choſroes</hi> neglected his agreement, and took <hi>Callinicum,</hi> none being to guard it. Their walls, being decayed, they were ever taking down to rebuild them, and then they had opened a piece, and not made it up. When they heard the enemy to be neer, the richer ſort carried out their goods, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to other ſtrong places. The reſidue, with a number of peaſants flock't thither, continued in the town without any garriſon. Theſe <hi>Choſroes</hi> made ſlaves, and laid the town even with the ground. Shortly after he recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>John</hi> the hoſtage, and retired into his country. The <hi>Armenians</hi> alſo, who revolted to <hi>Choſroes,</hi> took aſſurances from the <hi>Romans,</hi> and went with <hi>Baſſaces</hi> to <hi>Conſtantinople Beliſarius</hi> alſo went to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ſent for by the Emperour, to be immediatly diſpatcht into <hi>Italy,</hi> where things were very ill.</p>

               <p>ABout the ſame time was a Plague, which almoſt conſumed mankind. Of all blowes from heaven, bold and ſubtile men will talk of a cauſe, amazing us with reaſons, and phyſiologies above our apprehenſion; knowing nothing to be ſound they ſay; but contented, if they may perſwade with their coſenages, ſuch as frequent them. But of this to find any other cauſe is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, but God himſelf. For it came not upon one part of the world, nor in one ſeaſon of the yeare, from whence ſubtile wits might coyne a cauſe. But it vexed the whole world, and all conditions of men, though differing often even to contrariety; ſparing no conſtitution, nor age. Mens differing in their places of dwelling, diets, complexions, addictions, or any thing elſe in this diſeaſe did no good. It took ſome in the ſummer, ſome in the Winter, others at other ſeaſons. So that let <hi>Sophiſters,</hi> and diſcourſers of <hi>Meteors</hi> ſhew their learning; I will onely relate where it began to rage, and in what manner it deſtroyed. It began among the <hi>Egyptians</hi> of <hi>Peluſium,</hi> and ſpread to <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> and the reſt of <hi>Egypt</hi> one way, and the other, to that <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> which borders upon <hi>Egypt.</hi> From thence it travelled through the world, as by ſet journeyes and ſtages; removing as by appointed giſtes; and ſtaying in each countrey a certaine time; and making deſtruction its onely buſineſs; and ſpred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on both ſides to the utmoſt bounds of the world, as if affraid, leaſt any odd hole of the earth ſhould eſcape it. It ſpared neither Iland, nor cave, nor top of mountaine, which had men dwelling in it. If it skipt a countrey, by not touching it at all, or but here, and there; yet returning afterward, it ſtruck no more the neighbouring people formerly viſited, but from that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try it removed not the ſore, before it had juſtly made up the full meaſure of the dead, according to the lot of their periſht neighbours. It began ſtill at the ſea-coaſt, and from thence went to the uplands. In the ſecond yeare of it, it came to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> about the middle of the Spring; where it was my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune then to reſide. And it was in this ſort. Apparitions of Spirits in all ſhapes humane, were ſeen by many; who thought the man they met, ſtruck them in ſome part of the body; and ſo ſoon as they ſaw the Spirit, they were taken
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50471:37"/>with the diſeaſe. At firſt men meeting ſuch, bleſſed themſelves; repeating the moſt divine names; and uſing other ceremonies; but did no good; For many who fled into Churches periſht. Afterwards, they would not heare their friends calling, but lockt up in their chambers, ſtopt their eares, though the dores were even broken open; fearing the Sprite called on them. Some in their dreames ſuffred that, which others from thoſe that met them; or heard a voice, that they were enrolled in the appointed to dy. But moſt without warning by dreames, or waking viſions, ſuddainly became feaveriſh; ſome newly waking; ſome walking; others doing other things. Their body changed not colour, nor was hot, as in a feaver, no inflammation being, but the feaver ſo remiſſe in the beginning, and ſo till evening, that neither the ſick, nor the phyſician feeling his pulſe apprehended danger. But to ſome the ſame day, to ſome the next, or many after, there roſe a <hi>Bubo,</hi> not onely in the groyne (which part is called <hi>Bubo</hi>) but in the armeholes, under the eare, and in other parts. Theſe things came alike to all; but the ſymptomes afterward, I cannot ſay, whether the difference of bodies made, or the onely will of him, that ſent the ſickneſs. Some had a deep ſlumbring; others a ſharp diſtraction; both ſuffering, what was proper to the diſeaſe. Theſe ſlumberers forgot all they were formerly uſed to; ſeeming perpetually to ſleep. If they were look't to, they would eate ſometimes; and ſome neglected, ſtarved. Thoſe taken with madneſs, were troubled for want of ſleep, and with many apparitions; thinking men aſſaulted them to kill them, crying out, and running away. Their keepers vexed with endleſs toyle, were pittied as much as themſelves: Not for being infected (for no Phyſician, nor other, caught the diſeaſe by touching ſicke or dead bodies; many ſtrangely continuing free, though they buryed, and tended ſuch as were nothing to them; and many catching it, they knew not how, and dying in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly;) but they pittied their perpetuall toyle; in raiſing them tumbling upon the ground; and in ſtrugling with them, when they would throw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out of windowes. Such as could, leaped into the water, not for thirſt, but cauſed by their phrenſie; for many leap't into the Sea. Much toyle they had alſo to get them to eat; and many, for want of keepers, were ſtarved, or brake their necks. Some without ſlumbring, or madneſs, had their <hi>Bubo</hi> gangrened, and they dyed with extreame paine. Which doubtleſs happened to the reſt, but being not themſelves, they underſtood it not; the <hi>Phrenſie</hi> taking away their ſenſes. Some Phyſitians upon theſe ſymptomes, conceaving the head of the diſeaſe to be in thoſe plague ſores, ſearcht the dead bodyes, and opening the ſores, found a huge carbuncle, growing inward. Some died forthwith, ſome after many dayes. Such, whoſe bodies were ſpotted with black pim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, the bigneſs of a lentile, lived not a day. Many, a voluntary vomiting of bloud ſeizing, died. This I can ſay, that many famous Phyſicians judged ſome inſtantly would dye, who unexpectedly grew well; and confidently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the recovery of others, who were vpon the point of death. So that no cauſe of this ſickneſs was reach't by mans reaſon; ſome event happening to all, whereof no reaſon could be rendred. Some bathing helped, others it hurt; Many dyed for want of cure; and many ſcaped without it; it proving both wayes to thoſe that uſed it. In a word no way was found of preſervation, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by preventing the diſeaſe, nor maſtering it; no cauſe appearing neither of their falling ſick, nor recovering. Women with child taken with it, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dyed; ſome miſcarrying; ſome fairely deliver'd, and periſhing with their children. Yet they ſay that three women were delivered, who grew well, their children dying; and one dyed, whoſe child had the happ to live. Such as had their ſore great, and running with putrefaction, eſcaped; the ſame aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaging the violence of the carbuncle; and this was commonly a certaine ſigne of health. But whoſe plague-ſore ſtay'd, as it firſt roſe, ſuch had the miſerable accidents, I mentioned. Some had their thigh withered, the ſore riſing upon it, and not running. Some eſcaped with imperfect tongues, and lived ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50471:37"/>10000 and more. In the beginning, men took care to bury each his own dead, caſting ſome into other mens Monuments, either unſeen or by force. But in the end all was in confuſion: Servants were without Maſters; and rich men wanted ſervants to attend them; being ſick or dead; and many houſes were empty. So that divers for want of acquaintance lay long unburied.<note place="margin">The Greek fails here, and it is ſupplied from the Latine tranſlation.</note> * The Emperour (as was reaſon) made it his own care; and committed the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight to <hi>Theodorus,</hi> whoſe office was to ſubſcribe the Emperours anſwers to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions (the <hi>Latines</hi> call him <hi>Referendarius.</hi>) To them that wanted, and to the poor multitude, he gave reliefs in mony out of the Treaſury.

But <hi>Conſtantianus</hi> fell ſick upon the way; and the Plague at laſt came into <hi>Perſia.</hi> But <hi>Nabedes,</hi> Governour of <hi>Perſarmenia,</hi> by the Kings command, ſent <hi>Euduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> Prelate of the Chriſtians there, unto <hi>Valerianus,</hi> Commander of the forces in <hi>Armenia;</hi> to complaine of the ſlowneſſe of the Ambaſſadors; and to exhort the <hi>Romans</hi> to peace. He came into <hi>Armenia</hi> with his brother, and told <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianus,</hi> that he heartily affected the <hi>Romans,</hi> being <hi>Chriſtians</hi> as himſelf; and would ſo perſwade <hi>Choſroes,</hi> that the Ambaſſadors ſhould find no impediment of concluding a peace to their own deſire. But the Prelates brother getting privately to <hi>Valerianus,</hi> told him; That <hi>Choſroes</hi> in great diſtreſſe deſired a peace; his ſonne conſpiring againſt him; and his army being full of the Plague. <hi>Valerianus</hi> upon this ſent away the Prelate; promiſing the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors ſhould ſhortly come to <hi>Choſroes;</hi> and the ſaid advertiſement he wrote to <hi>Juſtinian.</hi> Who thereupon directed him and the Army to invade the <hi>Perſians;</hi> for he ſaw not that any enemy would oppoſe them; willing all the forces to joyn, and enter into <hi>Perſarmenia.</hi> The Captains upon theſe Letters rode with their troopes into <hi>Perſarmenia.

Juſtus</hi> alſo the Emperours Nephew, and <hi>Peranius,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> the ſon of <hi>Nicetas,</hi> with <hi>Domentiolus,</hi> and <hi>John Phagas,</hi> encamped at <hi>Phiſon,</hi> a Caſtle near unto <hi>Martyropolis.</hi> Thus were theſe Commanders quartered, with their ſeverall troops; amounting in the whole to thirty thouſand. Theſe joyned not, nor communicated; ſave when the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals ſent to one another to know news of the <hi>Perſians. Peter</hi> upon a ſudden motion, without acquainting the reſt, invaded the enemies country. And the next day, <hi>Philemuth</hi> and <hi>Verus,</hi> with their <hi>Herulians</hi> followed. <hi>Martinus</hi> and <hi>Valerianus</hi> hearing thereof, marcht likewiſe to the Invaſion. Shortly all joyned in the enemies country, ſave <hi>Iuſtus,</hi> who was quartered far off; but hearing (though late) that his fellow Commanders were entred the enemyes land, he marcht thither alſo, but could not unite his troopes with theirs.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50471:38"/>Thoſe Generalls marcht directly to <hi>Dubis;</hi> neither forraging, nor other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe hurting the country. <hi>Dubis</hi> is a Territory eight dayes journey from <hi>Theodoſiopolis,</hi> of good land, wel ſcituated for air, and water; being fair cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians, full of populous villages cloſe together, and inhabited by Merchants, who traffique with the <hi>Indians,</hi> and neighbouring <hi>Iberians,</hi> and with all the <hi>Perſian</hi> Nations, and ſome <hi>Romans.</hi> The Biſhop of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> the <hi>Greeks</hi> call <hi>Catholicus,</hi> who hath the charge of all the country. Some fifteene miles from <hi>Dubis</hi> to the right hand comming from the <hi>Roman</hi> Territories, ſtands a ragged mountain, hardly to be paſſed, and in a very narrow paſſage a village called <hi>Anglon,</hi> where <hi>Nabedes</hi> hearing of the enemies comming, kept faſt; confident of the ſtrength of the place. The village is at the furtheſt end of the mountain; where, upon a ſteep rock, ſtands a Caſtle of the ſame name. <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedes</hi> fortified the paſſage to the village with ſtones, and waggons, and drew a trench before, and lodged his army in the ſaid village; and in old houſes without it, layed ambuſhes of foot. The <hi>Perſians</hi> amounted in all to four thouſand men. The <hi>Romans</hi> came to a place, diſtant a dayes journey from <hi>Anglon,</hi> and took a ſcout of the enemies, who told them, that <hi>Nabedes</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired from <hi>Anglon. Narſes</hi> at this chafed, reproaching his fellow Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for their tardineſſe. The ſame others did likewiſe; taunting one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And now careleſſe of fighting, and fearleſſe of dangers, they attended pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laging onely. They marcht confuſedly, without diſcipline, without watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word (as is uſuall in ſuch actions) or diſtinction by any kind of order. The ſouldiers were mingled with the attendants upon the baggage, and marcht as to ſome great booty ready dreſt for them. Being near <hi>Anglon,</hi> they ſent out ſcoutes, who brought them word, that the army was inbattail array. The Commanders were amazed with the ſuddainneſſe; yet thought it baſe and cowardly to turn their backs with ſo great an army. So ordering the army as well as in that caſe they could; they marcht againſt the enemy. <hi>Peter</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the right hand wing, <hi>Valerianus</hi> the left, and <hi>Martinus</hi> the battell. Being come near the enemy, they ſtood ſtill in their ranks confuſedly, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ragged ground, and their being newly put in order. The <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> alſo drew cloſe together, and ſtood viewing the enemies powers; <hi>Nabedes</hi> had commanded none to ſtrike the firſt blow, but the enemy giving on, to reſiſt him. <hi>Narſes</hi> with his <hi>Herulians,</hi> and ſome <hi>Romans,</hi> gave on upon the <hi>Perſians;</hi> and them he routed, who ran away up to the Caſtle. Much miſchief was done between them in the narrow paſſage; and <hi>Narſes</hi> preſſed upon the enemy, and encouraged his men; and the reſt fell to work. But ſuddainly the Ambuſhes iſſuing from the old houſes, into the narrow lanes, killed ſome <hi>Herulians,</hi> and wounded <hi>Narſes</hi> in the head mortally, whom his brother <hi>Iſaac</hi> carried off; but he dyed quickly, having in this fight done bravely. The <hi>Romans</hi> upon this growing to confuſion, <hi>Nabedes</hi> drew out all his army, which in thoſe narrow lanes ſhooting at a multitude, killed them at eaſe, and moſt the <hi>Herulians;</hi> being the moſt part unarmed, and in fight never uſing head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, corſlet, or other defenſive armour, ſave a ſhield, and a thick coat girt about them. Their ſlaves fight without ſhields, which their maſters permit them to weare, when they have ſhewed themſelves good ſouldiers. But the <hi>Romans</hi> not enduring the enemy longer, fled amain, remembring neither va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, ſhame, nor ought that good is. The <hi>Perſians</hi> ſuſpecting, that they could not fall to ſo ſhameleſſe a running away, but had ſome ambuſhes; drave them out of the faſtneſſes, and then turn'd bridle, not daring with a few to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo many in a plain. But the <hi>Romans</hi> (ſpecially the Commanders) think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the enemy ſtill purſuing, ran without intermiſſion; urging their horſes with whip and voice; throwing away their arms in haſte; as having no cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to fight with a <hi>Perſian</hi> over-taking, but all their hope of ſafety in their horſes feet. In a word, it was ſuch a running away, as ſcarce a horſe over-lived it, but inſtantly dyed, the courſe ended. So great a diſaſter the <hi>Romans</hi> have not formerly had. Many were ſlain, more made ſlaves to the enemy, who took ſo great a quantity of arms and baggage, that the rich ſtate of <hi>Perſia</hi> appeared much richer by this victory. <hi>Adolius</hi> in this retreat, paſſing by a Caſtle in <hi>Perſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armenia,</hi>

For in his firſt Invaſion, miſſing <hi>Edeſſa,</hi> and reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſo; he and his <hi>Magi</hi> were much diſcontented to be overcome by the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> God. Wherefore he threatned to make the <hi>Edeſſenians</hi> ſlaves, and to turn their City to a Sheep-paſture. Being come before <hi>Edeſſa</hi> with his army, he ſent ſome <hi>Hunnes</hi> to the walls over againſt the <hi>Circus</hi> to ſteal the ſheep, kept near the walls by ſhepheards, preſuming upon the ſtrength, and ſteepneſſe of the place. But the <hi>Barbarians</hi> got to the ſheep, and the ſhepheards ſtoutly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted; but with the aid of ſome <hi>Perſians</hi> they got away one flock; which ran back again, while ſome <hi>Romans</hi> ſallying fought with them: Where a <hi>Hunne</hi> fighting in the front, and moſt troubling the <hi>Romans,</hi> a country fellow hit him with a ſling-ſtone on his right knee, and down he fell headlong; which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged the <hi>Romans.</hi> The fight laſted from morning till noon, and both thinking they had the better, parted, the <hi>Romans</hi> to their walls, and the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians</hi> to pitch their tents a mile from the City, where they encamped. <hi>Choſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes,</hi> either upon ſome dream, or the apprehenſion of diſgrace to miſſe <hi>Ediſſa</hi> twice, thought of ſelling his retreat to the <hi>Edeſſenians</hi> for money. <hi>Paul</hi> the Interpreter therefore the next day, under the town-walls, adviſed the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> to ſend men of quality to <hi>Choſroes.</hi> They choſe four eminent men; whom <hi>Zaberganes</hi> met in the camp, by the Kings direction; and with threatning words asked them; which they would rather have, a Peace, or a War. They confeſſing to chuſe peace before dangers: Then muſt you buy it, quoth <hi>Zaber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganes,</hi> with a great ſumme. They ſayd they would give as much as formerly; when he came thither after the ſack of <hi>Antioch. Zaberganes</hi> laught; and bade them conſult ſeriouſly for their lives; and come back again. Shortly after <hi>Choſroes</hi> ſent for them, and recited the <hi>Roman</hi> towns he had led into captivity; threatning to them alſo the terribleſt uſage, if they gave him not all their money within their walls; upon which onely he would raiſe his ſiege. The Ambaſſadours acknowledged, that they would buy their peace, if he enjoyned poſſibilites. But the concluſion of a danger, they ſaid, no living man could know before the combat; war being not upon articles of agreement between the parties. Upon this <hi>Choſroes</hi> commanded them in anger to get them gone.</p>
               <p>The eighth day of the Siege, he beganne to raiſe a mount againſt the walls; making, without arrow-ſhot, a ſquare work of trees cut down with leaves on, ſpreading over them much earth, and over all, a quantity of rude unwrought ſtones (his onely care being to raiſe the Mount ſpeedily) putting between the earth and ſtones long timbers, which faſtned the work; that growing high, it ſhould not be weak. But <hi>Peter</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Generall being in the town, with <hi>Martinus</hi> and <hi>Peranius,</hi> ſent out <hi>Hunnes</hi> againſt the workmen, who falling on ſuddainly, killed many. One of his Lanciers, named <hi>Arger,</hi> killed above ſeven and twenty. But the <hi>Barbarians</hi> kept better guard afterward, and none ſallyed on the workmen: Who being come within arrow-ſhot, the <hi>Romans</hi> from the walls ſtoutly employed their ſlings and bows. Before their labourers in this <hi>Aggeſtus</hi> (ſo is it called in <hi>Latine</hi>) the <hi>Barbarians</hi> hung upon long poles hair-cloths of Goats hair, thick and long, that no fiery darts nor arrows could pierce through, but there fell dead.

Where being, the <hi>Perſians</hi> above heard the noiſe; and finding what they did, croſs-mined on both ſides, to catch them in the middle. They perceaving it, ſtopt up their mine there with earth; and from underneath the part of the Mount next the town, carryed out the timber, ſtones, and earth, and made a little hollow roome; where they laid dry loggs ſteep't in Cedar oyle, and <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> pitch. During this preparation the <hi>Perſian</hi> commanders in many meetings with <hi>Martinus</hi> diſcourſed to the effect afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, ſeeming to entertaine a parley for Peace.

And now the flame roſe cleerly; when the <hi>Perſians</hi> abandoned the work. Six dayes after they aſſaulted ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before day-light, (the <hi>Romans</hi> being dead aſleep): And they ſet to their ladders, and were mounting: But a peaſant awaking, called up the <hi>Romans.</hi> They fought; and the <hi>Perſians</hi> were beaten to their camp; leaving their lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which the <hi>Romans</hi> drew up. About midnight <hi>Choſroës</hi> ſent a great part of his army to force the great Gate. The <hi>Romans</hi> (not onely Souldiers, but peaſants and people) ſtood them, had the better, and routed them. As they were running, <hi>Paul</hi> the Interpreter put himſelf among the <hi>Romans,</hi> and told them, that <hi>Recimer</hi> was newly come from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> an Ambaſſador about peace. So they parted. <hi>Recimer</hi> came to the <hi>Barbarians</hi> camp ſome dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; which they concealed from the <hi>Romans;</hi> expecting the event of their works; if thoſe proſper'd, they reſolved to come to no treatie; if they were beaten (as they now are) they might come to it fairely; the <hi>Romans</hi> having invited them. When <hi>Recimer</hi> was neer the city gate, the <hi>Perſians</hi> demanded ſome to be ſent out to treat an accord with <hi>Choſroës.</hi> They anſwered, they would within three dayes ſend <hi>Martinus,</hi> who now was ſicke. <hi>Choſroës</hi> ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the anſwer not to be ſincere, prepared for warr; commanding ſtore of bricks to be laid upon the Mount. Two dayes after he approached the walls with his whole army, and applyed his ladders and engines; and begirt the town; placing ſquadrons at every gate, &amp; <hi>Saracens</hi> behind them; who when the town was taken, were to lay hold on run-awayes. The fight began in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and at firſt the <hi>Perſians</hi> had the better; being many againſt few; for the <hi>Romans</hi> were not aware of the aſſault. The fight proceeding, the city was full of tumult; the women and little children went to the walls; and the men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted valiantly; Many peaſants did bravely. The women and children with the old men brought ſtones to the combatants. Some threw down boyling oyle. Then the <hi>Perſians</hi> refuſed to fight any longer; telling the King plainely, they would not give on: <hi>Choſroës</hi> in a rage, threatning and urging them, brought them all on. And againe with ſhouts they applied their ladders, and engines, as if they would inſtantly enter. But the <hi>Romans</hi> defending in great numbers, the enemy fledd; and the <hi>Romans</hi> hiſs't at <hi>Choſroes;</hi> daring him to the aſſault. Onely <hi>Azarethes</hi> with his troupes continued fighting about the gate of <hi>Soëna;</hi> and from a place called <hi>Tripugia,</hi> the valianteſt of the <hi>Romans</hi> ſallied. Other <hi>Perſians</hi> aſſaulting an outwork, preſt hard upon the defendants, till <hi>Peranius</hi> with many ſouldiers, and ſome <hi>Edeſſenians,</hi> having routed <hi>Aza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rethes,</hi> rode up to theſe. So that <hi>Choſroes</hi> beginning the aſſault in the morning, gave it over late at night: Both paſſed the night unquietly; the <hi>Perſians</hi> affraid of their trenches; the <hi>Romans</hi> providing ſtones and other things againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſſault the next morning; when the <hi>Barbarians</hi> came not on. But the day after, a part of the army animated by <hi>Choſroes</hi> ſet upon the gate of <hi>Barlaim;</hi> but were beaten back to their camp. Then <hi>Paul</hi> the Interpreter called up to the walls for <hi>Martinus,</hi> to treat an accord.

               <p>About this time died two <hi>Roman</hi> commanders, <hi>Justus, Juſtinians</hi> nephew, and <hi>Peranius</hi> the <hi>Iberian;</hi> the firſt by ſickneſs, the other by a fall from his horſe in hunting.

               <p>But in <hi>Lazica, Choſroes</hi> had a deſign to kill <hi>Gubazes</hi> their King,<note place="margin">Here the Greek continues.</note> * and to tranſplant the Nation into ſome other part of his dominions, and to plant <hi>Perſians</hi> in their room: For he thought it a matter of much importance, firmly to poſſeſſe <hi>Lazica,</hi> being of manifold uſe to the <hi>Perſians:</hi> Firſt, by holding more ſecurely the <hi>Iberians,</hi> who would have none to fly to in caſe of revolt: For the principall <hi>Iberians</hi> with their King <hi>Gurgenes</hi> revolting (as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) the <hi>Perſians</hi> ſuffered not the nation to chuſe their King any more; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were they willing ſubjects to the <hi>Perſians,</hi> but both were ſuſpicious of each other; and the <hi>Iberians</hi> diſcontented, and ready to ſtir upon fit oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity. He conſidered alſo, that not onely the <hi>Perſian</hi> dominions would here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be for ever free from the devaſtation of the <hi>Hunnes</hi> bordering upon <hi>Lazica;</hi> but that himſelf, having a mind, might ſend them againſt the <hi>Romans;</hi> there being no rampire againſt the <hi>Barbarians</hi> of Mount <hi>Caucaſus,</hi> but only <hi>Lazica.</hi> But principally <hi>Lazica</hi> would advantage the <hi>Perſians,</hi> by iſſuing from thence to infeſt by land and ſea the places upon the <hi>Euxine</hi> ſea, to ſubdue <hi>Cappadocia, Galatia,</hi> and <hi>Bithynia,</hi> and to ſurpriſe <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> there being none to ſtop their courſe. Upon theſe conſiderations <hi>Choſroes</hi> would have <hi>Lazica,</hi> but could not be confident in the Nation. For after the <hi>Romans</hi> were retired from thence, the common people were diſcontented at the <hi>Perſians</hi> Government, who of all men have leaſt variety in their humours, their manner of life being extreamly ſtrict; their laws hard of diſgeſtion, and their commands intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable. And in reference to the <hi>Lazians</hi> the difference infinitely appeared, both in Religion and converſation; the <hi>Lazians</hi> being Chriſtians, none more; and the <hi>Perſians</hi> quite contrary. Beſides, no Salt being in <hi>Lazica,</hi> nor Wine, nor other native commodity; all is imported from the ſea coaſts of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi> not giving money to the Merchants, but skins, and ſlaves, and other things with them abounding. From which being now barred, they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented. And <hi>Choſroes</hi> perceiving it, conſulted upon ſome ſafe prevention, before they ſhould ſtirre for an alteration; and thought it moſt expedient to rid away <hi>Gubazes</hi> their King, and to tranſport the Nation, and to plant <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> and others in their country.</p>
               <p>He ſent alſo to <hi>Conſtantinople Iſdigunas,</hi> under pretext of an Ambaſſage, and with him five hundred choſen <hi>Perſians,</hi> directing them to get into <hi>Daras,</hi> and lodging in ſeverall houſes to ſet them afire, and while the <hi>Romans</hi> were buſie to quench the fire, to open the gates, and receive in the reſt of the <hi>Perſian</hi> army; the Governour of <hi>Niſibis</hi> being commanded to be in readyneſſe with forces concealed thereabout. Thus <hi>Choſroes</hi> thought without labour to have the killing of the <hi>Romans</hi> in <hi>Daras,</hi> and to be maſter of the City. But a <hi>Roman</hi> fugitive in <hi>Perſia</hi> having knowledge of it, went to <hi>Daras,</hi> and there revealed it to <hi>George;</hi> who formerly perſwaded the <hi>Perſians</hi> beſieged in <hi>Siſibranum</hi> to yeeld to the <hi>Romans.

                  <q>this was not like not Ambaſſage; and that <hi>Perſians</hi> in ſo great numbers uſe not to lodge in <hi>Roman</hi> Cities; he ſhould do well to leave the reſt in a town called <hi>Amudis,</hi> and with a few in his company to enter <hi>Daras.</hi>

Juſtinian</hi> meant to performe his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, but greater buſineſs diverting him, he ſent not the money in the due time. But <hi>Dagiſthaeus,</hi> being a young man, and unable to manage a <hi>Perſian</hi> warr, made no advantage of the opportunities offered him: Whereas he ſhould have ſent to the Paſſage the moſt of his army, and been himſelf at the action, he ſent, as to ſome ſlight buſineſs, onely two hundred men. And he did nothing upon <hi>Petra</hi> with all his forces: The enemy within, at firſt were not 1500. men, who continually being ſhot, and ſlaine at the aſſaults; after as much valour, as ever men ſhewed, were reduced to a very few; and diſpairing, and unable, lay ſtill. The <hi>Romans</hi> drew a mine under the wall; and the wall falling with a houſe joyning to it, fell all into the Ruine, ſecuring the town as much as the wall. This troubled not the <hi>Romans,</hi> who ſaw hope, by mining in another part, to take the town: and <hi>Dagiſthaeus</hi> wrote of it to the Emperour; urging for rewards of victory, and appointing what he and his brother ſhould have; for they would take <hi>Petra</hi> preſently. But the <hi>Perſians</hi> receaved the aſſaults bravely, and beyong expectation; their troopes being much decayed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Romans</hi> prevailing not, they mined againe, and came on with their work ſo, that the foundation of the wall had no ground to beare it, and the wall was in the aire, ſuddainly to fall. And if <hi>Dagiſthaeus</hi> had preſently put fire to the ſupporters, the town had been taken. But he with his hopes from the Emperour, dallying, did nothing.</p>

In the meane time <hi>Mermeroes</hi> was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred at the <hi>Paſſage</hi> by the two hundred <hi>Romans:</hi> who valiantly kept off the aſſailants. But the <hi>Perſians</hi> perſiſting, and being ſtill ſupplied with new men for their ſlaine (having loſt more then 1000.) The <hi>Romans</hi> weary with killing, and overpreſt with numbers, ran up to the mountaines. <hi>Dagiſthaeus</hi> hereof advertiſed, preſently raiſed the ſiege, and without giving any direction to the army, away he gallopt towards the <hi>Phaſis,</hi> and all the <hi>Romans</hi> followed; leaving their baggage in the camp.

The dead bodies the ſurvivors never threw from the walls, but endured almoſt ſtifling with the ſtench; that the enemy, ſeing ſo many loſt, might not be the more encouraged to aſſault. <hi>Mermeroes</hi> ſaid ſcoffingly, that the <hi>Romans</hi> affaires were to be lamented, being fallen into ſo weak a condition, as not to be able with all their endeavour to force 150. <hi>Perſians,</hi> that had no walls to defend them. But the walls he care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully repaired, and wanting lime and other materialls, he filled with ſand the linnen wallets, wherein the <hi>Perſians</hi> brought their proviſions, and laid them inſteed of ſtones; and this ſerved for walling. In the town he left 3000 choſen men, with a proportion of victuall for no long time, and direction to repaire the walls. Himſelf with the reſt of his army returned homeward; And becauſe if he marcht the ſame way he came, he would find no proviſions, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving left what he brought out of <hi>Iberia</hi> in <hi>Petra;</hi> he went over the mountains, which, he heard, were inhabited; that by forraging he might make his army live. But one <hi>Fubelius,</hi> a noble man of <hi>Lazica,</hi> conducting <hi>Dagiſthaeus,</hi> and 1000. <hi>Romans,</hi> ſurprized the <hi>Perſians</hi> where they lodged; and having ſtolne ſome horſes at paſture, and killed ſome who kept them, retired; and <hi>Merme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes</hi> roſe from thence. But <hi>Gubazes</hi> not affrighted with what happened to the <hi>Romans,</hi> quitted not the <hi>Paſſage</hi> on his ſide, ſuppoſing there to be the maine of his hopes. For though the <hi>Perſians</hi> forced through the Paſſage beyond the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> and got to <hi>Petra;</hi> yet he could not incommode <hi>Lazica,</hi> being not able to croſs the <hi>Phaſis</hi> without ſhipps; the river is ſo deep and broad, and ſo ſwift, that it enters the Sea a good way unmingled with ſalt water, &amp; out of it paſſengers take in freſh water: And with ſhipps, the many Fortreſſes on this ſide, will make an enemies landing unſafe. <hi>Juſtinian</hi> alſo at laſt ſent the monyes for the <hi>Sabirians,</hi> and other for <hi>Gubazes,</hi> and the <hi>Lazians.</hi> Long before he had ſent a good army thither commanded by <hi>Recithangus</hi> the <hi>Thracian,</hi> a wiſe man, and a good ſouldier; but it was not yet arrived. <hi>Mermeroes</hi> having gotten to the mountaines, would have provided victuall for <hi>Petra,</hi> knowing, that that he had left, would not ſerve a Garriſon of 3000. men. But what he could light on in the country, hardly ſufficing his own army of 30000. he could ſend nothing to <hi>Petra</hi> worth the ſpeaking. So he reſolved with the moſt of his army to quit <hi>Lazica,</hi> and leave ſome few, who of the proviſions they could get, were to tranſport moſt to <hi>Petra,</hi> and to live upon the reſt. And ſo 5000. choſen men he left with <hi>Fabrizus,</hi> and three other commanders. He thought a greater ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my not needfull; there being no enemies. With the reſidue he went into <hi>Perſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armenia,</hi> and lay quiet in the townes of <hi>Dubis.</hi> The 5000. upon the furtheſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of <hi>Lazica,</hi> encamped by the river <hi>Phaſis,</hi> ſtragling to plunder thereabout; <hi>Gubazes</hi> obſerving it, ſent to <hi>Dagiſthaeus</hi> to come up to him, as having it in his power to doe the enemy a notable miſchief. He did ſo, marching with the river <hi>Phaſis</hi> to his left hand, till he came where on the other ſide encamped the <hi>Lazians,</hi> and where the river was fordable. This neither the <hi>Romans,</hi> nor <hi>Perſians</hi> knew (not knowing the countrey) but the <hi>Lazians</hi> knew it, and there paſſed the river, and joyned with the <hi>Romans.</hi> The <hi>Perſians</hi> ſent out 1000 choſen men to prevent an enemies infeſting their camp: And two of theſe
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50471:42"/>advancing to diſcover, fell into the enemies hands, and diſcovered all to them. So the <hi>Romans</hi> ſuddainely ſet upon the 1000. men, of whom none eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped, but were moſt ſlaine, and the reſt taken. <hi>Gubazes</hi> learnt the number of the <hi>Perſian</hi> army, how farr off they were, and in what eſtate. They march't therefore towards them, computing to fall on them farr within the night. They were in number fourteen thouſand. The <hi>Perſians,</hi> without thought of an enemy, ſlept ſecurely. They thought the river not fordable, and their 1000. men farr upon their way, without encountring any. So that the <hi>Romans</hi> unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted charging them after midnight, found ſome aſleep, ſome newly awake, and naked upon their pallets; not a man with a thought of fighting; But moſt of them thus ſurprized were ſlaine. Some they tooke, among whom a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall commander. Some few eſcaped in the darke. The camp the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Lazians</hi> took, with all their Enſignes; and had the booty of much armes, and goods, and of Horſes and Mules a great number. They followed the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion farr into <hi>Iberia;</hi> where lighting upon other <hi>Perſian</hi> troopes, they killed many. The <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Lazians</hi> alſo found there a quantity of meale and other proviſion, and burnt it; which the <hi>Perſians</hi> were conducting out of <hi>Iberia</hi> to <hi>Petra.</hi> So they left at the Paſſage ſome numbers of <hi>Lazians,</hi> that no provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to <hi>Petra</hi> might paſſe that way; and then returned with all their booty and captives. And thus ended the fourth yeare of the <hi>Perſian</hi> affaires, being the three and twentieth of <hi>Juſtinian's</hi> raigne.</p>
               <p>The yeare before,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno Dom. 548. &amp; 23. Juſtiniani.</hi> was the fourth yeare of the truce, where <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gathias</hi> begins.</note>

For the Devilluſes to diſplay before unſetled judgements, with ſome great hopes, that which they natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally love: and ſo was this <hi>John</hi> deluded by ſome Juglers; who told him he ſhould weare the habit of <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> And in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was a Prieſt, who kept the treaſures of the Church of <hi>S. Sophia,</hi> named <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> When <hi>John</hi> was ſhorne a Prieſt (having him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf no garment fit,) they, who were employed in it, made him put on the Cope and Rochet of this <hi>Auguſtus;</hi> And ſo, I think, the prediction was fulfilled.</p>

               <p>BUT <hi>Honorius</hi> holding the Weſtern Empire, the <hi>Barbarians</hi> invaded his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: Who they were, and in what manner, I will tell you. Heretofore were many <hi>Gothick</hi> Nations, and now are; but the greateſt, and moſt famous of them are the <hi>Goths, Vandals, Viſigoths,</hi> and <hi>Gepaedes.</hi> Anciently they were called <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matians,</hi> and <hi>Melanchlenians.</hi> Some called, theſe, <hi>Getick</hi> Nations.

I ſuppoſe them to have been anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently one Nation, and their names to have been diſtinguiſhed afterward by their ſeveral Princes. Formerly this people inhabited about the river <hi>Danubius;</hi> then the <hi>Gepaedes</hi> held the places about <hi>Singedon</hi> and <hi>Sirmium,</hi> on both ſides the River where now they are.

Then they ſay that the Eunuch of <hi>Honorius,</hi> then being at <hi>Ravenna,</hi> who kept his Cocks of the game, told him the news how <hi>Rome</hi> was loſt; He cryed out, <hi>Why! even now he eat from mine own hands,</hi> (He had an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary great Cock named <hi>Rome</hi>) The Eunuch underſtanding him, told him, that the City <hi>Rome</hi> was loſt by <hi>Alaricus:</hi> The Emperour rouſing himſelf replied, I thought, my friend, it had been my Cock <hi>Rome.</hi> So ſimple, they ſay, was that Emperour. Some ſay that <hi>Alaricus</hi> took not <hi>Rome</hi> thus: But that <hi>Proba</hi> a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Lady eminent for wealth and honour, pittying the people periſhing with miſeries, and for famine eating one another, and ſeeing no hope of better, (the River and Port being block'd up by the Enemy) directed her ſervants in the night to open the gates; <hi>Alaricus</hi> at his parting from <hi>Rome,</hi> declared <hi>Attalus,</hi> one of the Nobility, Emperour, putting on him the Diadem and Purple robe, and all other enſigns of the Imperial dignity; that by this he might depoſe <hi>Honorius,</hi> and give <hi>Attalus</hi> the Weſtern Empire. But <hi>Attalus</hi> had neither wit himſelf, nor could follow good counſel; ſending into <hi>Africk,</hi> without <hi>Alaricus</hi>'s conſent, Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours without an Army.</p>

                  <hi>Britany</hi> then revolted from the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the Souldiers choſe <hi>Conſtantine</hi> their Emperour, an eminent man, who with a Fleet and a good Army invaded <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Gaule.

And whereas there is a <hi>Roman</hi> Law, That men out of poſſeſſion the ſpace of thirty years, cannot enter upon the diſſeiſors; but before are by preſcription barred their action in Court for the ſame; <hi>Honorius</hi> by his Edict commanded the <hi>Vandales</hi> continuance in <hi>Roman</hi> Land, not to need that thirty years preſcription. In this eſtate <hi>Honorius</hi> left <hi>Italy,</hi> and died. With him <hi>Conſtantius</hi> was Emperour, who married his ſiſter <hi>Placidia,</hi> but died before <hi>Honorius;</hi> having had in his ſmall time in the Empire no means to act any thing, his ſon <hi>Valentinian</hi> from his nurſe was brought to the Palace of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> and there bred. But the Courtiers in <hi>Rome</hi> choſe Emperour one of the Souldiers named <hi>John;</hi> a mild and a prudent man, and valiant. He uſurped five years, but ruled moderately, not hearkning to informers, nor unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly killing nor confiſcating any: But againſt the <hi>Barbarians</hi> he could do nothing, by reaſon all at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was his enemy. <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Arcadius,</hi> ſent an Army againſt him under <hi>Aſpar</hi> and <hi>Ardaburius</hi> his ſon, and depoſed him; giving the Empire to <hi>Valentinian,</hi> yet a child, who took <hi>John</hi> cut off one of his hands, brought him into the Circus of <hi>Aquileia</hi> upon an aſs; and when he had endured much ſcorn and indignity from the Stage, there put him to death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Valentinian</hi> being thus Emperor of the Weſt, his mother <hi>Placidia</hi> bred him ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminately, that he became vicious from a child; he frequented Conjurers and Star-gazers, made love to other mens wives, and was extreamly debaucht, though he had a wife moſt beautifull: So that he was ſo far from recovering the loſt pieces of the Empire, that he added the loſs of <hi>Affrick,</hi> and ruined himſelf; and after his death his wife and children had the fortune to be captives.

                  <hi>GEnſerick,</hi> after the defeat of <hi>Aſper</hi> and <hi>Bonifacius,</hi> weighing wiſely the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of fortune, that new Armies might come from <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> that his powers would not match with the <hi>Romans;</hi> and that God changes mens fortunes as they grow old; he reſolved in his new victories to bear himſelf moderately, and not too high. So he made a league with <hi>Valentinian,</hi> paid him tribute, and left his ſon <hi>Honoricus</hi> in hoſtage; whom afterward he received home, when then friendſhip was more grown. In the mean time <hi>Placidia</hi> died at <hi>Rome; Valentinian</hi> having only two daughters by <hi>Eudoxia,</hi> ſiſter to <hi>Theodoſius:</hi> But he was ruined thus. <hi>Maximus</hi> a Senator, deſcended from that <hi>Maximus</hi> the Tyrant, deſtroyed by <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the elder, for which the <hi>Romans</hi> celebrate an annual feſtivals; had a very ſober and fair Lady to his wife. <hi>Valentinian</hi> being
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50471:49"/>in love with her, and deſiring to enjoy her, but finding it difficult, uſed this wicked plot. He ſent for <hi>Maximus</hi> to the Palace, and at Dice laid gold againſt his Ring, and won it; This he ſent ſecretly to the wife in the husbands name, requiring her to come immediately to viſit the Empreſs <hi>Eudoxia:</hi> She obeyed, and ſome acquainted with the ſecret waited upon her in the Court into a room far from the Empreſſes chamber;<note place="margin">Here the <hi>Greek</hi> continues.</note> There <hi>Valentinian</hi> met her, and raviſht her. She extreamly afflicted with the diſhonour, went home, all blubber'd with tears, and reviled <hi>Maximus</hi> for giving the opportunity: Who being infinitely grieved at it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired againſt the Emperour. But ſeeing the great power of <hi>Aetius,</hi> who lately had defeated <hi>Artilas</hi> invading the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire with a mighty Army of <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſagetes</hi> and other <hi>Scythians,</hi> and fearing him for an obſtacle of his proceedings, he determined firſt to remove him, not conſidering that in <hi>Actius</hi> was the whole hope of the <hi>Romans.</hi> So by the artifices of ſome Eunuchs about the Emperour, his friends, he infuſed into the Emperour, that <hi>Aetius</hi> was plotting a revolt. And <hi>Valentinian</hi> judging the information by no other argument but by the worth and power of <hi>Aetius,</hi> put him to death. When a <hi>Roman</hi> was famous for a word ſpoken, being askt by the Emperour, if the killing of <hi>Aetius</hi> were not well done? and anſwering, That he could not tell whether it were well done, or how it was done; but this he knew, that he had cut off his right hand with his left. <hi>Aetius</hi> being dead, <hi>Attilas</hi> having none to match him, forraged at his eaſe all <hi>Europe,</hi> and made both the Empires tributary, both the Emperours ſending him annual taxes.</p>
               <p>Then they ſay, <hi>Attilas</hi> beſieging <hi>Aquileia,</hi> a great and populous maritime City within the <hi>Ionian</hi> gulf, and not being able by force nor otherwiſe to get the town, and wearied with a long Siege, put his Army in readineſs to riſe the next day by ſun-riſing; and the <hi>Barbarians</hi> were buſie in their retreat accordingly: When a Stork having his neſt upon one of the turrets, where he had bred his young, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly with his young flew from the ſame, the young ones ſometimes flying even with him, ſometimes getting upon his back; and thus they fled far from the town. <hi>Attilas</hi> ſeeing it (being a very cunning Diviner) commanded his Army to ſtand ſtill, telling them that the Bird with his young ones was not fled away for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but propheſied ſome miſchief to the Town. Upon this they ſay the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians</hi> renewed their ſiege, and that the wall by the Storks neſt fell down of it ſelf, making the Town open to the enemy, and that ſo <hi>Aquileia</hi> was taken by aſſault.</p>
               <p>But afterward <hi>Maximus</hi> killed the Emperour, and married <hi>Eudoxia</hi> by force, his wife being newly dead. And in bed he ſpake a word once, how for her love he had done what he did. <hi>Eudoxia,</hi> before offended with <hi>Maximus,</hi> and deſirous to revenge the wrong done to <hi>Valentinian,</hi> by this word was more incenſed to plot againſt him, hearing thus from <hi>Maximus</hi> himſelf how her husbands diſaſter came for her ſake. So that, no ſooner day, but ſhe ſent to <hi>Carthage,</hi> entreating <hi>Genſerick</hi> to revenge <hi>Valentinian,</hi> ruined by a wicked man, in a manner unworthy of himſelf and the Empire; and to redeem her, ſuffering things abominable, from the Tyrant. She urged him as his Friend and Allie; and that it were impious, ſuch a villany ſhould be acted in a Kings houſe without a revenger; And from <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> ſhe expected no revenge, <hi>Theodoſius</hi> being dead, and <hi>Martianus</hi> in poſſeſſion of the Empire. <hi>Genſerick</hi> for no other reſpect, but finding he ſhould get wealth by it, ſailed into <hi>Italy</hi> with a great Navy, marcht up to <hi>Rome,</hi> and (none reſiſting) was Maſter of the Imperial palace. <hi>Maximus</hi> running away, the <hi>Romans</hi> ſtoned to death, and cut off his head, and rent his other members in pieces. <hi>Eudoxia</hi> with her two daughters by <hi>Valentinian, Eudocia</hi> and <hi>Placidia, Genſerick</hi> made priſoners; and carried away to <hi>Carthage</hi> infinite wealth of gold and ſilver, and ſpared neither Braſs nor any thing in the palace: He robbed the Temple of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter Capitolinus,</hi> and took away half the covering of it being of the richeſt braſs, with much gold melted in it, and very admirable and magnificent. They ſay, the ſhip where the Images were was caſt away, but with the reſt the <hi>Vandals</hi> landed at <hi>Carthage. Eudocia Genſerick</hi> married to his eldeſt ſon <hi>Honoricus;</hi> The other daughter was married to <hi>Olybrius</hi> a principal Senator of <hi>Rome,</hi> whom with the mother <hi>Eudoxia,</hi> at the Emperours requeſt, he ſent to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire

                  <hi>GEnſerick</hi> afterward took down the wals of all the Cities of <hi>Africk,</hi> ſave <hi>Carthage;</hi> That the <hi>Africans</hi> ſiding with the <hi>Romans</hi> might have no ſtrong places to gather head, nor the Emperours forces by taking towns and by garriſons in them, think to trouble the <hi>Vandals.</hi> His counſel ſeemed a good one then, to ſecure the <hi>Vandals:</hi> But afterward, when theſe Towns without walls were ſo eaſily taken by <hi>Beliſarius, Genſerick</hi> was laught at, and his wiſe counſel judged folly. Thus men ever change their opinions of counſels, with the fortunes of them. The rich and eminent men of <hi>Africk</hi> he gave as ſo many bond-men, with their lands and goods, to his ſons, <hi>Honoricus</hi> and <hi>Genſon, Theodorus</hi> being dead without iſſue: From the reſt he took their lands, and beſtowed them on the other <hi>Vandals,</hi> which are yet called the <hi>Vandals</hi> Heritages. All the Towns he gave his ſons, and others he called the Kings land, freeing the ſame perpetually from tributes: The ancient poſſeſſors the while had the fortune to be poor and free men, and had permiſſion to go whither they would.<note n="*" place="margin">Lat. verſ.</note> Some held, or claimed their lands to no purpoſe: Many were baniſhed and put to death upon no cauſe, ſpecially ſuch as were thought to have hid money in their houſes.

After the death of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian,</hi> he made every Spring a voyage to rob <hi>Sicily,</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> ſacking ſome Cities, and ſome laying flat with the ground.

               <p>The Emperour <hi>Leo,</hi> to reſtrain this inſolence, prepared an Army of 100000 men to ſend againſt the <hi>Vandals,</hi> and a great Navy, collected from all parts of <hi>Greece.</hi> This war, they ſay, coſt him a huge treaſure, and to no purpoſe. His Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral was <hi>Baſiliſcus,</hi> brother to his wife <hi>Verina,</hi> the truſtieſt man he had, and ſafeſt for him; friendſhip continuing yet between him and <hi>Aſpar,</hi> who, being an <hi>Arian,</hi> could not get the Empire, but with his power made <hi>Leo,</hi> againſt whom afterward he conſpired. And now fearing leſt the victory of the <hi>Vandals</hi> might make him proud, both to his particular, and in the government, he inſtructed <hi>Baſiliſcus</hi> at his departure to prolong the war. <hi>Leo</hi> alſo ſent <hi>Anthemius</hi> a Senator, great in blood and eſtate, to be Emperour of the Weſt, that he might be aiding to him in the <hi>Vandalick</hi> war. And <hi>Genſerick</hi> promiſed the Weſtern Empire to <hi>Olybrius, Placidia's</hi> husband, to joyn with him; upon which confidence he had higher thoughts, and more vexed the <hi>Roman</hi> dominions.<note n="*" place="margin">The Greek again.</note> In the mean time <hi>Marcelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus</hi> a friend of <hi>Aetius,</hi> (who after the murder of <hi>Aetius</hi> entred into action againſt <hi>Valentinian,</hi> and got the dominion of <hi>Dalmatia</hi> none oppoſing) <hi>Leo</hi> courted and gained; and then ſent him to the Iland of <hi>Sardinia,</hi> ſubject to the <hi>Vandals,</hi> whom <hi>Marcellianus</hi> preſently drave out and got the Iland.

But <hi>Baſiliſcus</hi> arrived with his Army at a ſmall Town 35 miles from <hi>Carthage,</hi> called <hi>Mercurium,</hi> from an ancient Temple of <hi>Mercury.</hi> And if he had not treacherouſly dallied, but marcht inſtantly to <hi>Carthage,</hi> he had taken the Town inſtantly, and made the <hi>Vandals</hi> his Captives. So much afraid was <hi>Genſerick</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:50471:50"/>of <hi>Leo,</hi> ſeeing <hi>Tripolis</hi> and <hi>Sardinia</hi> taken, and ſo brave a Navy as the <hi>Romans</hi> had not ſet out of a long time. But this the Generals either cowardly, or trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous delay hindred. But <hi>Genſerick</hi> made this good uſe of <hi>Baſiliſcus</hi> his neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligente. He armed his Subjects, manned moſt of his ſhips, and made ready of the reſt the ſwifteſt of ſail without men in them; then ſent Ambaſſadors to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiliſcus,,</hi> deſiring a five days ceſſation, that he might adviſe upon the means of doing the Emperours pleaſure. They ſay, he ſent him cloſely a great ſum of money, which bought this truce, ſuppoſing (which came to paſs) that he ſhould get in that time a wind to bring his ſhips about. And <hi>Baſiliſcus,</hi> either to comply with his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to <hi>Aſpar,</hi> or ſelling his opportunity, or whether he thought it ſo beſt, lay ſtil, attending the enemies advantage. But the <hi>Vandals</hi> (the wind ſerving) hoiſt ſail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the enemy, towing after the ſhips without men. When they came near, they put fire into the empty ſhips, whoſe ſails ſpreading to the wind, they let them run upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Navy. They falling in among a multitude of Veſſels, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly conſumed with themſelves, thoſe they fell foul with. In the mean time the <hi>Roman</hi> fleet was in confuſion, with cries equalling the winds, and the whizzing of the flames, and with the Soldiers and Mariners calling, and thruſting the fire-ſhips with long poles, from their own pittifully periſhing. The <hi>Vandals</hi> alſo ſhot, and ſunk the reſt, taking the flying Soldiers with Arms and all. Some in this over-throw did bravely; ſpecially <hi>John,</hi> Lieutenant General to <hi>Baſiliſcus,</hi> but not acquainted with his Treaſon: His ſhip being boarded, he ſlew many up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the deck; and when he ſaw the ſhip taken by the enemy, he leapt into the ſea with all his Arms. <hi>Genſon,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Genſerick</hi> wooed him, and gave him his faith to ſave his life; but he plunged into the ſea, uſing this word only, That <hi>John</hi> ſhould never come into the hands of dogs.</p>
               <p>And this was the end of this war: <hi>Heraclius</hi> returned home; <hi>Marcellianus</hi> pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſht by the Treaſon of one of his fellow-Commanders: But <hi>Baſiliſcus</hi> in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> took ſanctuary in the great Church dedicated to Chriſt, (the <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinopolitans</hi> call it the Church of St. <hi>Sophia,</hi> holding the attribute of wiſdom moſt becoming God;) and the Empreſs <hi>Verina</hi> obtained his pardon.

But he conſtrained the Chriſtians to change, not by tortures, as his Predeceſſors; but courting them with honours and offices, and with large gifts; taking no notice of ſuch as would not ſubmit. If he found a man in a great crime, he offered him impunity to change his religion. His wife being dead without children, and he deſirous to eſtabliſh his government with ſucceſſion, demanded to wife <hi>Amalafrida,</hi> the ſiſter of <hi>Theodorick</hi> King of the <hi>Goths,</hi> whoſe husband was lately dead: He ſent him his ſiſter with a guard of 1000 ſelected <hi>Goths,</hi> attended with 5000 more, fighting men; and he gave her <hi>Lilybaeum,</hi> one of the Promontories of <hi>Sicily.</hi> So <hi>Traſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi> of all the Princes of the <hi>Vandals</hi> ſeemed the moſt powerful. Yet in his reign the <hi>Vandals</hi> had a great overthrow from the <hi>Moors, Cabaon,</hi> Prince of the <hi>Moors</hi> about <hi>Tripolis,</hi> a man experienced in many wars, and very witty, hearing that the <hi>Vandals</hi> would make war upon him, firſt enjoyned his Subjects to forbear unjuſt dealings, delicious foods, and ſpecially the company of women: Then he made two Entrenchments; in the one himſelf lodged, and his men; in the other he ſhut up the women, making it death for any man to go into the womens Entrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Then he ſent Spies to <hi>Carthage</hi> with this direction, to mark what ſcorns the <hi>Vandals</hi> upon their march, did to the Chriſtians Churches; and when they were gone from the place, themſelves to doe the quite contrary. And they ſay he uſed this ſpeech, <hi>That 'tis true, he was ignorant of the God whom the Chriſtians worſhip: But it was likely (if he were ſo powerful as they ſay he is) that he will puniſh thoſe that ſcorn him, and defend thoſe that honour him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Spies having markt the <hi>Vandals</hi> preparations at <hi>Carthage,</hi> followed their Army in a poor diſguiſe toward <hi>Tripolis.</hi> The <hi>Vandals</hi> at their firſt dayes march lodged in the Chriſtians Churches, put in their horſes and other beaſts, and ſpared no kind of ſcorn. They practiſed therein all lewdneſs, and beat and whipt the Prieſts they found, commanding them ſervices which they impoſed on their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſlaves. So ſoon as they were gone, the Spies of <hi>Cabaon,</hi> according to his order, made the Churches clean again, took away the dirt and ſuch like profanely left in them, lighted the Lamps, did lowly reverence to the Prieſts, and uſed them cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, and to many poor about thoſe Churches gave money, and then followed the <hi>Vandals</hi> Army. Thus in all the journey, they mended herein what the <hi>Vandals</hi> offended: And being come neer, went before to <hi>Cabaon,</hi> and told him how far the enemy was, and what was done to the Chriſtians Churches. He preſently put in order to fight. The field where he would entrench, he took in with a circle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and placed his Camels ſide-long in a round to fence his Camp, making the Front 12 Camels deep: The women and children, unable men, and baggage he put in the middle, and his fighting men between the legs of thoſe beaſts with ſhields to ward with. The <hi>Vandals</hi> knew not what to do to this kind of batallion, being neither Archers, nor Darters, nor good Infantry, but moſt Horſ-men uſing the Lance and the Sword, and not able to hurt an enemy afar off; and their horſes not enduring the ſight of the Camels, would not approach the enemy, who dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at multitudes from a ſafe place, killed them and their horſes, that they ran away. The <hi>Moors</hi> followed the execution, and killed and took them, ſo that few came home. This fortune had <hi>Traſamund</hi> with the <hi>Moors,</hi> and after 27 years reign dyed.</p>

In ſuch expeditions at the <hi>Vandals</hi> had, <hi>Hoamer</hi> was Generall, his nephew, a good Souldier, whom they called the <hi>Achilles</hi> of the <hi>Vandals.</hi> In his reign the <hi>Vandals</hi> loſt a battel againſt the <hi>Moors</hi> of <hi>Byzacium,</hi> commanded by <hi>Antallas;</hi> and fell out with <hi>Theodorick</hi> and the <hi>Goths</hi> in <hi>Italy.</hi>

Of this <hi>Theodorick</hi> had no revenge, wanting a Navy to make war upon <hi>Africk;</hi> and <hi>Ilderick</hi> was an ancient friend of <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> who governed abſolutely then, (his Uncle <hi>Juſtin</hi> being very old, and not skill'd in affairs of State) and they courted each other with Preſents.</p>
               <p>There was of the race of <hi>Genſerick</hi> one <hi>Gelimer,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Gelgris</hi> the ſon of <hi>Genſon,</hi> of ripe years, and ſo expected immediately to ſucceed <hi>Ilderick.</hi> In war he was thought one of the beſt of his time, but wicked, and skilful in mutinies and rapines.

Juſtinian</hi> hereof adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, being now Emperour, ſent Ambaſſadors, and wrote thus to <hi>Gelimer. You doe not religiouſly, nor as is due to the teſtament of</hi> Genſerick, <hi>to keep in priſon an old man of your blood, and your King</hi> (<hi>if</hi> Genſerick's <hi>wiſe conſtitutions be worth ought</hi>) <hi>and to force from him a Kingdom, which ſhortly you will have by law. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed not in evil; nor change the title of a King to that of an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper, for a little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of time: But let him carry the image of Royalty to his grave (whereinto he is ſtepping) yourſelf having the execution of it already; and having the ſubſtance, attend upon the Law of</hi> Genſerick <hi>for the name. If you doe thus, you will find God propitious, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s your friend.</hi> But <hi>Gelimer</hi> ſent away the Ambaſſadors unſatisfied; put out <hi>Hoamers</hi> eyes, and kept <hi>Ilderick</hi> and <hi>Evagees</hi> in ſtraiter priſon, accuſing them to have attempted an eſcape to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> Upon this <hi>Juſtinian</hi> ſent other Ambaſſadors, and wrote thus. <hi>We did not think, you would have done the quite contrary to our advices. But ſeeing it pleaſes you to get a Kingdom thus, take what fortune gives you. But ſend to us</hi> Ilderick, <hi>and blind</hi> Hoamer <hi>and his brother, to get ſuch comfort, whereof men are capable, who have loſt Kingdoms and eye-ſights. If you refuſe this, we will not endure it. The hope they had in our friendſhip induces us; and the Treaties with</hi> Genſerick <hi>cannot ſtop us, being not to make war upon, but to vindicate his Succeſſor.</hi> To this <hi>Gelimer</hi> made this anſwer. <hi>King</hi> Gelimer <hi>to the Emperour</hi> Juſtinian. <hi>I have neither taken the Kingdom by force, nor committed impiety againſt mine own blood.

'Tis good for a man to govern the State he hath, and not to encroach upon other mens cares; and 'tis juſt in you, who have a Kingdom of your own, not to be thus medling. If you break the Treaties, and invade us, we ſhall oppoſe you to our power; calling to witneſs the oath ſworn by</hi> Zeno, <hi>whoſe ſucceſſor you are. Juſtinian</hi> was angry before, but theſe letters more ſet him upon a revenge: And being an acute deviſer, and nimble in execution, he reſolved to conclude the <hi>Perſian</hi> war ſpeedily, and then to invade <hi>Africk. Beliſarius</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Eaſt was, then at Court, ſent for; but with no word of leading an Army into <hi>Africk.</hi> It was given out, that he was diſcharged of his government: And<note n="*" place="margin">An. dom. <hi>533.</hi> Juſtiniani ſepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo.</note> the <hi>Perſian</hi> perpetual Truce was newly made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> (all being wel at home, and with <hi>Perſia</hi>) at a conſultation acquainted the great Officers, that he would levy an Army againſt <hi>Gelimer</hi> and the <hi>Vandals.</hi> The moſt of them were diſcontented at it, remembring the overthrow of <hi>Baſiliſcus,</hi> and that great Fleet of the Emperour <hi>Leo,</hi> the Souldiers loſt, and the huge debt made by the State. Above all, the Prefect of the Palace, (whom the <hi>Romans</hi> call <hi>Praetor</hi>) was netled at it, and the Lord High-Treaſurer, and all Collectors of tributes, both belonging to the Treaſury and the <hi>Emperour;</hi> conſidering how they muſt ſupply the neceſſities of the war infinitely, and not be admitted to excuſe or delay. And every Generall, doubting the employment, apprehended the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the hazard; after eſcaping the ſea, to encamp in an enemies country, and upon their landing to fight with a great and potent Kingdom. The Souldiers
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50471:52"/>newly returned from a long and difficult war, ſcarce having taſted of their home-contentments, were troubled to be led now to a Sea-fight (a thing they had never heard of) and to be ſent from the Eaſt to the Weſt, to hazard againſt <hi>Vandals</hi> and <hi>Moors.</hi> All others (as is the manner of multitudes) meant to be ſpectators of new buſineſſes, with other mens danger. None durſt croſs the voyage, ſave <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Cappadocian,</hi> Prefect of the Palace, being the boldeſt and ſmarteſt man of his time: He (while others mourned in ſilence) ſpake thus to the Emperour. <q>Sir! The ſecurity of converſing with you gives me confidence, to ſpeak things expedient for your ſervice, though not pleaſing. Your wiſdom hath ſo temper'd power &amp; juſtice in you, that you judg not him abſolutely a friend to your affairs who ſeconds you, nor are offended with oppoſing you; weighing things by the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere meaning: which makes it ſafe to differ from your counſels. Hereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, Sir! I ſhall adviſe happily what for the preſent may offend, but here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after I ſhall make my affection apparant, and call you for a witneſs. If you ſhall begin a war with the <hi>Vandals,</hi> and then find it grow into length, my counſel will then appear good. If your confidence ariſe from aſſurance of victory, no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail you venture men, ſpend money, and engage the toyls of ſuch combats; for victory gotten covers theſe afflictions of war. But ſeeing this is in the hands of God, and that looking upon foregoing preſidents, we cannot but fear the event of this war; certainly to content our ſelves with quietneſs, is better, then the hazards of battels. You will ſend an Army againſt <hi>Carthage,</hi> whither by land it muſt march 140 dayes journy; or ſail the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And if you vanquiſh your enemies, yet you cannot be maſter of <hi>Africk, Sicily</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> being in other hands. But if you be overthrown, (the Peace being broken) you will draw the war upon your own country. In a word, it will not be in your power to enjoy the victory; and if fortune be croſs, it will ruine the affairs well ſetled. Before action, conſultation is profitable: when the blow is given, it is vain to repent; but before it, one may ſafely change his mind: It will be moſt expedient therefore to make due uſe of the times.</q> The Emperour approved this adviſe, and let fall his eagerneſs to the war. But a Biſhop out of the Eaſt got acceſs to him, and told him, <q>That God had charged him in a dream to blame him; having undertaken to deliver the Chriſtians in <hi>Africk</hi> from Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie, to grow faint now upon no ground; whereas I will aſſiſt him (ſaid he) and make him maſter of <hi>Africk.</hi>
                  </q> The Emperour upon this could hold no longer; but prepared an Army and a Navy, and proviſions, requiring <hi>Beliſarius</hi> to be in readineſs to goe Generall into <hi>Africk.</hi>

               <p>BUt in the ſeaventh year of <hi>Juſtinians</hi> reign, about the Summer Tropick, the Army was embarqued; and <hi>Beliſarius</hi> the General commanded the Praeto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian ſhip to ride under the Emperours Palace. Thither came <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of the City; and having prayed as was fitting, he put aboard a Souldier newly baptized,<note n="*" place="margin">Being ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the beginning of the Secret Hiſtory.</note> 
                  <hi>Whoſe Godfather and Godmother were</hi> Beliſarius, <hi>and</hi> Antonina, <hi>being one of their houſhold, and named</hi> Theodoſius, <hi>and much valued by them.</hi> And thus the ſaid General and his wife put to ſea. With them was <hi>Procopius;</hi> the Writer of this Hiſtory; who at the firſt was afraid of this Voyage; but a dream, he had, encouraged him, and made him eager upon it. He dreamt he was in <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſarius</hi> his houſe, whom a ſervant told that one had brought him preſents; that <hi>Beliſarius</hi> bad himſelf go look upon them; and he in the inner Court, ſaw men carrying flowers growing with their earth; which he commanded them to lay down in the Porch. That then <hi>Beliſarius</hi> came with his Life-Guard, ſate down upon that earth and eat of the flowers, willing the reſt to do the like, who fell to, and ſeemed much pleaſed with the dainties. Thus was the dream. But the fleet followed the Praetorian ſhip, and at <hi>Perinthus,</hi> now called <hi>Heraclia,</hi> ſtaid five days; where the Emperour gave the General almoſt all his horſes of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures in <hi>Thrace.</hi> From thence they came before <hi>Abydus,</hi> where being becalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed four days; it fell out that two <hi>Maſſagetes</hi> in their drink (the <hi>Maſſagetes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all great drunkards) killed one of their Countreymen, whom <hi>Beliſarius</hi> cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified upon a hillock near <hi>Abydus.</hi> The reſt, eſpecially the kinſmen of the men, murmured; That they came not to aid the <hi>Romans</hi> upon terms of ſubjection to their Laws; and by their own Laws, murders had no ſuch puniſhments. Some <hi>Roman</hi> Soldiers murmured too; ſuch as would not be puniſhed for their offences. Whereupon <hi>Beliſarius</hi> ſpake thus to the Army. <q>To men that never ſaw wars, I ſhould need a long ſpeech to perſwade, how great a preparation for victory it is, to be juſt. But you by often vanquiſhing enemies, not inferiour in bodies, and very valiant; and by often having the contrary ſucceſs, have learnt; that men fight in both the Armies, but God determines the victory, as himſelf pleaſes. So that we muſt make leſs account of good bodies, of arms, and warlick prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, then of juſtice and duty to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For men in need are to honour that moſt, which is moſt able to do them good. Now the principal mark of juſtice is, the puniſhment of murderers: For if we muſt judge of right and wrong, by what men do to one another; certainly to a man nothing is ſo precious as life. If any <hi>Barbarian</hi> killing his Countryman in drink, upon that pleads im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity; I conceive his excuſe aggravates his crime: For a man muſt not be ſo drunk as to kill his beſt friends; ſpecially in an Army; nay drunkenneſs it ſelf, without murder, deſerves puniſhment. And then to wrong ones own Nation, appears more heinous to any man of underſtanding, then a ſtranger. The exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and event of ſuch doings you may all yonder behold. And you muſt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin quarrels, nor take away ought which is other mens. Neither will I endure that man, or eſteem him a ſouldier of mine, who cannot employ innocent hands againſt our enemies, No valour will get the victory, which is not rankt with juſtice.</q> The Army upon this ſpeech, and ſeeing the crucified men, and expecting the danger of committing unlawfull acts, grew afraid, and reſolved to live ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Then, that the whole Army might ſail, and lie at anchor together (in a great fleet many ſhips neceſſarily being caſt behind, ſpecially if the wind blow high, and the ſhip-maſters know not what leader to follow) he painted the maſts of his own ſhip, and two others where his train was, from the top about a third part, with red, and in their ſterns ſetting up high poles, hung up lanterns, that the Generals ſhips might be ſeen both by night and day. And to theſe he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the ſhip-maſters to hold their courſe; which thus leading the whole fleet, not one ſhip was caſt behind. And at weighing anchor from any harbour, the Trumpets ever ſounded the warnings. From <hi>Abydus</hi> a ſtiff wind brought them
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50471:53"/>to <hi>Sigaeum;</hi> from whence being becalmed, they came late to <hi>Malea.</hi> There the calm ſtood them inſtead; for the want of ſea-room for ſo great a fleet, and in the night, troubled, and endangered the ſame. The Mariners did bravely, calling out, and thruſting with their long poles, and skilfully keeping their diſtances but if the wind had riſen ſtrong, and againſt them, they had with much adoe ſaved the ſhips. But getting by, they reached <hi>Taenarus,</hi> now called <hi>Caenopolis.</hi> From thence they came before <hi>Methône</hi> where they found <hi>Valerianus</hi> and <hi>Martinus,</hi> arrived a little before; and the wind not ſerving, <hi>Beliſarius</hi> landed the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. There he diſtributed the Commands, and ordered the Soldiers; and being therein buſie, and the wind not ſerving, many of the Army died of a ſickneſs thus occaſioned, <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Cappadocian,</hi> a bad man, was ingenuous to find projects for money to the treaſury, with the ruine of men; (a man beyond my power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe; and in my former Hiſtory I have ſpoken of him;) but now he deſtroyed theſe ſoldiers thus. The bread for the Army, to make it laſte, and not corrupt too ſoon, is to be twice baked; and ſo of neceſſity muſt weigh leſs; and the ſoldiers, in the giving it out, muſt have a fourth part leſs in weight. <hi>John,</hi> that he might ſpend leſs wood, and wages upon bakers, &amp; by gain the weight, brought the loaves unbaked to the publick bath, and put the ſame into the ſtove there, under which the fire is made, and being thus ſorrily baked, ſent it in bags to the fleet: which being at <hi>Methone,</hi> the bisket turn'd to dough, and that mouldy, corrupt, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uſty; and the Officers diſtributed it thus to the ſoldiers by pecks, and ſometimes by buſhels. Who feeding upon it in the Summer, and a place of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream heats, grew ſick, and above 500 died; and more had, if <hi>Beliſarius</hi> had not provided bread of the Country to help them. He acquainted the Emperour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, who commended him for it: but he could not get <hi>John</hi> puniſhed as then.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Being near the ſhore, <hi>Beliſarius</hi> commanded to caſt anchor; and aſſembling the Commanders conſulted of their landing. After ſome diverſity of opinions, <hi>Archelaus</hi> ſpake thus, <q>Our General is to be commended highly, who having the advantage of wiſdom, experience and power, yet conſults, and commands us to ſpeak our opinions of landing, though knowing by his own obſervations, what muſt and may be done. And I cannot but admire you the Commanders for ſo readily perſwading our landing; who know that to exhort men to an immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent danger, brings no advantage to the adviſer, but laies him open to an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. For men when things ſucceed to their deſire, are pleaſed, and that's all; but when otherwiſe, they accuſe the author of the advice; though it be unjuſt that a man for his counſel in publick deliberations ſhould be queſtioned. But reſolving thus to land in an enemies Country, in what Port will you leave your ſhips? What fortification, or walled Town expect you? The coaſt from <hi>Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> to <hi>Carthage,</hi> you hear is nine days journey open to all winds, and without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny harbour: And in all <hi>Africk,</hi> by <hi>Genſerick</hi> his command, no walled Towns are ſtanding but <hi>Carthage:</hi> And the Country, I am told, is deſtitute of waters. And if in the midſt of theſe incommodities we meet with an enemy, what ſhall we reſolve then? ſhall we not think ſuch counſels infuſed rather by ſome unlucky <hi>Damon,</hi> then humane reaſon? Our ſhips alſo, when we are landed, and a ſtorm comes, muſt either be ſcattered infinitely, or elſe periſh upon this ſhore. Then for your neceſſary ſupport, what ſupply expect you? Let no man look upon me the Commiſſary for Proviſions. Then there are no ſervants for you, the ſoldiers muſt ſupply that Office. To conclude, where will you put your ſpare arms and baggage? and when you need ſuch, whence will you be furniſhed? My opinion is, to ſail directly for <hi>Carthage,</hi> where there is a haven four miles and a half from it, called the <hi>Pool,</hi> unguarded and capable of a great fleet, from whence you may make the war, and eaſily take <hi>Carthage.</hi>
                  </q> And then having vanquiſht the enemy far <q>from thence, nothing will be difficult nor dangerous to Conquerours. For na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, the head once gon, the reſt fals of it ſelf. Theſe things you are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, and chuſe the beſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>After this ſpeech, <hi>Beliſarius</hi> began thus. 'Let none, fellow Commanders, think me to ſit here a judge of what hath been ſpoken, nor to ſpeak laſt, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <q>my ſentence neceſſarily to be followed. I have heard your opinions, and my part is to propound what I conceive, and together with you to chuſe the beſt.</q> One thing you muſt remember, that the ſoldiers even profeſs to fear a ſea-fight, and if the enemy come, to turn their backs to them. And in that caſe <q>it is fooliſh to pray to God for ſucceſs, being afraid, and our ſelves procuring the contrary event. If then we ſail to <hi>Carthage</hi> and encounter an enemies Navy and our men fly from them, our counſel will be followed with repentance and complaints. A fatal error admits ſome excuſe, but this none. And if a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt happen (which is moſt urged to fright us, and not well) and our ſhips be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>attered (as they ſay) or periſh upon this coaſt: I pray which is leſs hurt, to have our ſhips caſt away alone, or with them, all the reſt of us to fall by the enemy? Beſides, falling upon the enemy unprovided, and not looking for us,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50471:54"/>we may ſubdue him; but when he is armed and prepared, we ſhall hazard a war upon equal terms. Concerning the proviſion of neceſſaries, and how we ſhall put aſhore, it is not now time to conſult, nor enquire. Shall we ſtay for a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ipeſt to fall upon our Navy in a fight (as often happens) and then begin to learn what to do? I think we ought forthwith to land, taking with us our horſes, arms, and other needfull things; and preſently to entrench our ſelves within a good Rampire (which will defend us as the ſtrongeſt wall) and from thence make the war. And think not to want any thing, if we fight valiantly. Who vanquiſh their enemies, all they have is theirs; Victory brings all to that ſide it enclines to.</q> In your ſwords therefore conſiſts your ſafety, and aboundance.</p>
               <p>All the Counſel eaſily conſented to this, and roſe; forthwith landing the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, three months after their departure from <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> The General choſe by the ſea-ſide, a place which both ſoldiers and mariners fortified with trench and rampire; and by multitude of hands concurring, and the General urging, it was finiſhed the ſame day. Digging the earth, they came to much water (a thing never before ſeen in <hi>Byzacium,</hi> a dry Country) which ſupplyed men and beaſts. <hi>Procopius</hi> congratulated with the General, not ſo much (as he ſaid) for the water, as for the preſage of an eaſie victory, which proved ſo indeed. That night the Army lodged in the Camp, ſet their watches and did all as is uſual. Only aboard every ſhip <hi>Beliſarius</hi> appointed five Archers, and the light Gallies to lie round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them to prevent ſodain miſchief.</p>

               <p>THe next day ſome ſoldiers went up into the Country, and ſtole their ripe fruits, whom the General ſeverely chaſtiſed; and calling the Army together, ſpake thus. <q>To feed upon other mens goods by violence, is at all times wicked, becauſe unjuſt; But now, ſetting the conſideration of juſtice aſide (though that were hard) it is ſo aboundantly inconvenient, that we muſt fear the danger: we are here put aſhore with this only confidence, that the <hi>Africans</hi> being anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently <hi>Romans,</hi> are unſure, and ill affected to the <hi>Vandals.</hi> From this I did hope for ſupply of neceſſaries, and to avoid miſchief from the enemy. But now your intemperance hath changed all to the contrary. You have reconciled the <hi>Africans</hi> to the <hi>Vandals,</hi> and turn'd their hatred upon your ſelves, (for wrong'd men naturally hate them that do them the preſent violence;) and ſo you have for a little gain now ſold your future ſafety, and plenty. By buying what you needed, you might have avoided the imputation of injuſtice, and made the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners your friends. Now you muſt have the war with <hi>Africans</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> too; nay with God himſelf; whoſe aſſiſtance no man can invoke, doing wrong. But give over this ſharking, and quit your hands of a gain ſo full of hazard: The proper time now being, when ſobriety muſt preſerve us, and diſorder will bring certain death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If you be carefull of theſe things, God will be propitious, the people of <hi>Africk</hi> well affected, and the <hi>Vandals</hi> eaſie to be dealt with.</q>
               </p>
               <p>After this ſpeech, <hi>Beliſarius</hi> ſent <hi>Boraides,</hi> one of his life-guard, with ſome of his Targetiers, to <hi>Syllectus</hi> a ſea-town in the way to <hi>Carthage,</hi> and a days jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from the Camp; whoſe Inhabitants, he heard, inſtead of their demoliſhed walls, to have fortified each man his own houſe, to keep off the <hi>Moors,</hi> and ſo to have made a kind of Town wall. <hi>Boraides</hi> he inſtructed to attempt the Town, and taking it, to do no hurt, but with repreſenting many conveniences, and how they come to ſet them at liberty, to get entrance for the Army. They about candles lighting getting near the Town, paſt the night in a deep bottom there; and the next morning overtaking ſome Peaſants, they ſlipt into the Town with them, and poſſeſt it; then without tumult, called the Biſhop, and principal of the Town; told them their Generals inſtructions, and immediately receiving the keys from them, ſent the ſame to the General. The ſame day the Maſter of the Kings Poſts revolted, and gave up all his horſes. The General alſo took one of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50471:55"/>thoſe that ride with the Kings Packets, which they call <hi>Veredarii,</hi> and did him no hurt, but took his oath to deliver <hi>Juſtinians</hi> Letters, written to the <hi>Vandals,</hi> into the hands of the Governours. Which ſignified thus. <hi>We make no war upon the</hi> Vandals, <hi>nor infring the Treaty with</hi> Genſerick. <hi>But we endeavour to free you from an uſurper; who, diſreſpecting the Teſtament of</hi> Genſerick, <hi>keeps your King in priſon, and hath begun to deſtroy ſuch of his bloud, whom he hated; and of the reſt, hath put out their eyes, and impriſoned them, not ſuffering them to end their ſorrows by death. Aſſiſt us therefore to free you from ſo wicked Tyranny, that you may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy peace and liberty: which to obſerve to you, we make oath here to God.</hi> The man that took theſe Letters from <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> durſt not ſhew them, but to ſome privat friends, and did nothing material.</p>

Him he directed to march ſome two miles and a half before the Army, and to give warning, if they ſee an enemy, that the Army may prepare for fight. And to the left hand of the Army, he directed the <hi>Maſſagetes</hi> to march. And himſelf was in the rear with his beſt men, looking for <hi>Gelimer</hi> to come ſhortly from <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mione.</hi> To the right hand was no fear, being to march by the ſea-ſhore; and the ſeamen he commanded to keep them company, by letting down all their ſails, but their ſprit ſail, in caſe of a ſtrong gale; and in a calm, to force their way with oars. When they came to <hi>Syllectus, Beliſarius</hi> had his ſoldiers moſt ſober, not ſtriking, nor uſing any diſorder. And the <hi>Africans</hi> he ſo gained with his gentleneſs, that he marcht as in his own Country; the people not withdrawing themſelves nor goods, but giving free market, and being very ſerviceable to the ſoldier. They marcht ten miles a day, till they came to <hi>Carthage,</hi> lodging ſtill in a Town, or ſafely in their Camp. We came by <hi>Lepta</hi> and <hi>Adrymettum</hi> to <hi>Graſſa,</hi> about 43 miles from <hi>Carthage;</hi> where was a Palace of the <hi>Vandal</hi> Governor, and the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Gardens we ever ſaw, aboundantly watered with fountains; and with a large grove of trees loaded with ripe fruit, whereof the ſoldiers took their fill without any miſs, every man ſetting his cabbin under a fruit-tree.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Gelimer</hi> hearing the enemies arrival, wrote from <hi>Hermione</hi> to <hi>Carthage,</hi> to his brother <hi>Ammatas,</hi> to kill <hi>Ilderick,</hi> and the other priſoners of his bloud, and otherwiſe appertaining to him; and himſelf to arm the <hi>Vandals,</hi> and ſuch forces as he had in the City; and at the narrow paſſage near a town called <hi>Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum,</hi> to charge the enemy on both ſides, and ſo to catch him as in a net. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matas</hi> accordingly killed <hi>Ilderick,</hi> and his couſin <hi>Evagees: Hoamer</hi> was dead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. He armed alſo the <hi>Vandals,</hi> to ſally in the due time. <hi>Gelimer</hi> followed us cloſe; and one night only, as we lodged in <hi>Graſſa,</hi> he gave us an alarm; upon ſome skirmiſhing of our ſcouts with theirs; by whoſe returning to the Camp, we underſtood the enemy to be near. From hence marching, we loſt ſight of our ſhips, being put to go about ſome high rocks there, and a Promontory under which ſtands <hi>Mercurium. Beliſarius</hi> ſent word to <hi>Archelaus</hi> the Commiſſary, not to put in at <hi>Carthage,</hi> but to ſtay 25 miles ſhort, till he ſend for them. From <hi>Graſſa</hi> the fourth day we came to <hi>Decimum,</hi> about 8 miles from <hi>Carthage.</hi> This day <hi>Gelimer</hi> ſent his Nephew, <hi>Gibamumdus,</hi> before with 2000 <hi>Vandals,</hi> to march to our left hand; that ſo <hi>Ammatas</hi> from <hi>Carthage.</hi> himſelf in our rear, and <hi>Giba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundus</hi> at our left hand, charging together, might compaſs us.</p>

               <p>FOr my part, I could not but wonder in this battel to ſee, how God knowing the event, draws out the model thereof to his own will; and how men are ignorant whether they miſtake, or whether they be upon a right counſel, that a way ſo may be made to the ſucceſs before determined. If <hi>Beliſarius</hi> had not commanded <hi>John</hi> to advance before the Army, and the <hi>Maſſagetes</hi> to march at our left hand, we could not have eſcaped the <hi>Vandals.</hi> And for all this, the <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals</hi> could not have been ſo ruined, if <hi>Ammatas</hi> had not come to <hi>Decimum</hi> about noon, three hours ſooner then his time, we being then farr ſhort of it, and the <hi>Vandals</hi> Army alſo. And this was not all his fault. He came with a few, and thoſe not of his beſt, to encounter <hi>John,</hi> leaving the main body in <hi>Carthage,</hi> with direction to come after to <hi>Decimum.</hi> He killed 12 good men of ours in the head of <hi>Johns</hi> troops, but himſelf fell, having ſhewn much valour; and being fallen, the reſt were routed, and running away, turned the whole body marching from <hi>Carthage;</hi> who being in no order to fight, but in ſmall parties of thirty and twenty together, and ſeeing <hi>Ammatas</hi> troops running, and imagining multitudes purſuing, ran back for company. Whom <hi>Johns</hi> Troops killed up to the gates of <hi>Carthage;</hi> And ſo great was the execution of that 8 miles, that one would have gueſt it the work of 20000 men at leaſt. <hi>Gibamundus</hi> at the ſame time, and his 2000 men, came to the Salt plains, five miles from <hi>Decimum,</hi> on the left hand of the way to <hi>Carthage,</hi> a place without men or trees, or ought elſe (the ſaltneſs of the water hindring the grouth of any thing but ſalt;) here falling upon the <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſagetes,</hi> they periſht every man. Among the <hi>Maſſagetes</hi> was a man valiant and ſtrong, but Captain of a few; who had a priviledge from his anceſtors, in all encounters to charge firſt; and no <hi>Maſſagete</hi> to ſhoot or ſtrike till he began the fight.</p>
               <p>This man rode up cloſe to the <hi>Vandals</hi> Army; who either amazed with his da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, or ſuſpecting ſome plot of the enemy, ſtirred not ſo much as to ſhoot at him; fearing (it may be) to venture, hearing the <hi>Maſſagetes</hi> to be a warlick Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and having never ſeen their manner of fighting. But he returning, told his Countrymen, that God had ſent them thoſe ſtrangers ready dreſt; So they gave on furiouſly, and the <hi>Vandals</hi> breaking their ranks, and not reſiſting, baſely pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſht every man. We without hearing theſe accidents, marcht towards <hi>Decimum.</hi> And <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> in a convenient place, ſome four miles from <hi>Decimum,</hi> fortified an entrenchment, and placed his foot in it; and then made this ſpeech to the Army. <q>Now, fellow Soldiers! is come the time of our tryal. Our enemies, I hear, are marching towards us; and our ſhips, by the ſcituation of the place, are ſevered from us; and now our only hope of ſafety is in our ſwords; having neither Town nor Fortreſs to be bold upon. If we now do valiantly, we ſhall in likelyhood ſubdue our enemies; but if we faint, nothing remains, but to be beaten, and periſh by the enemy: Advantages for victory we have: Firſt, We fight for the poſſeſſion of that which in right is ours; then do the <hi>Vandals</hi> hate their own uſurping Tyrant, and commonly God aſſiſts the rightfull cauſe; and the ſoldier ill affected to his Prince, never fights valiantly for him. Beſides, we have ſpent our time againſt <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Scythians;</hi> but the <hi>Vandals,</hi> ſince their Conqueſt of <hi>Africa,</hi> have ſeen no enemy but naked <hi>Moors.</hi> Now, in every Trade practiſe breeds skill, and diſuſage ignorance. Our Entrenchment from whence we are to make the war, is finiſhed; where leaving our arms which we cannot carry, and baggage, we may ſallie, and retiring, find what we need. I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat therefore every man to think upon his reputation, and the pledges he hath left at home, and ſo undanted to encounter the enemy.</q>

                  <hi>BEliſarius</hi> having thus ſpoken, and ſaid a prayer, leaving the guard of his wife and the Camp to the foot, he ſallied with his horſe. He thought not good to hazard with the whole Army, but firſt to skirmiſh with his horſe, and try the enemy, then to give battel with the main; ſo he ſent the Confederates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and followed with the reſt, and with his own Lanciers and Targetiers. The Confederates being come to <hi>Decimum,</hi> found the bodies of the 12 companions of <hi>John;</hi> and cloſe by them the body of <hi>Ammatas,</hi> and ſome other <hi>Vandals.</hi> Being in doubt, and not knowing whether to go further; and from a hil diſcovering round, they ſaw a duſt, and ſoon after a great troop of <hi>Vandals.</hi> They ſent to <hi>Beliſarius</hi> to come ſpeedily; the enemy being upon them; and the Commanders, ſome urged to charge the enemy, others alleadged their forces not ſufficient. While they were diſputing, the <hi>Barbarians</hi> came up cloſe, with <hi>Gelimer</hi> in the head of them; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving paſſed between the way where <hi>Beliſarius</hi> went, and that where the <hi>Maſſagetes,</hi> who had fought with <hi>Gibamundus;</hi> but the hilly ground between, hindred their ſight of <hi>Beliſarius;</hi> or his entrenchment, and of the defeat of <hi>Gibamundus.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near, each contended to poſſeſs the higheſt down, which ſeemed apt for an entrenchment. The <hi>Vandals</hi> running hard, gained the down, and grown terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, routed the enemy. The <hi>Romans</hi> fan away to a Town leſs then a mile from <hi>Decimum,</hi> where was <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>liaris,</hi> one of <hi>Beliſarius</hi> his life-guard, and 800 of his Targetiers. The <hi>Vandals</hi> ſtaid their courſe, thinking that <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>liaris</hi> would ſtand them; but his troops, ſo ſoon as the other began to charge, fled amain to <hi>Beliſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi> It was ſtrange, that <hi>Gelimer</hi> having thus the victory in his hands, ſhould vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily quit it. But God, when he wil have a miſchief befall a man, infects his reaſon, not ſuffering the moſt expedient things to come into his mind. If he had followed the execution, <hi>Beliſarius</hi> himſelf had not ſtood him, but we had al been abſolutely ruined; ſo great ſeemed the number of the <hi>Vandals,</hi> and the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> fear. Or if he had rode on to <hi>Carthage,</hi> he had killed the troops of <hi>John,</hi> every man, (who were careleſly ſcattered, and rifling the dead bodies) and had ſaved the City, and been Maſter of our ſhips, and cut off all our hope, either of victory or return home: But he did neither; but riding ſoftly down the hill, and in the plain, finding his brothers dead body, he ſpent the time in lamentations, and about the funeral, and thus loſt his opportunity, which he could never recover. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> ſtopt his flying men, chiding them; and hearing of the death of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matas;</hi> and the brave execution of <hi>John;</hi> and informed ſufficiently of the place and the enemy, he marched againſt <hi>Gelimer</hi> and the <hi>Vandals:</hi> who being in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, and unprepared, ran away amain, with the loſs of many, (the execution laſting till night) and fled not to <hi>Carthage,</hi> nor <hi>Byzacium,</hi> from whence they came; but toward the plains of <hi>Bule,</hi> and the way to <hi>Numidia.</hi> About evening, <hi>John,</hi> and the <hi>Maſſagets</hi> alſo came to us; and relating, and hearing the ſeveral ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, lodged with us that night in <hi>Decimum.</hi>

               <p>THe next day our foot coming up, with <hi>Beliſarius</hi> his wife, we marcht toward <hi>Carthage;</hi> and arriving within night, lodged abroad near the City. No man would have oppoſed our entrance; the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> opening their gates, and the City ſhining all night with lights and bonfires; and the <hi>Vandals</hi> remaining, were fled into the Churches. But <hi>Beliſarius</hi> feared in the night ſome ambuſh, and the ſoldiers diſorder, leſt in the dark they might fall to pillage. The ſame day alſo the fleet came up to the Promontory, and the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had opened the iron
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50471:56"/>Chain of <hi>Mandracium</hi> their haven, to let it in. In the Palace is a dark priſon, called <hi>Ancon,</hi> (or the Elbow) for ſuch as the Tyrant was offended with. Here at that time were many Eaſtern Merchants, whom the Tyrant accuſed to ſollicite the Emperour to invade him; and the ſame day that <hi>Ammatas</hi> was ſlain in <hi>Decimum,</hi> he had given order for their execution.</p>
               <p>The keeper of the priſon hearing the accident at <hi>Decimum,</hi> and ſeeing the fleet within the Promontory, went to the men (who had heard nothing, but ſate in the dark expecting death) and askt them what they would give to be ſaved from thence. They promiſing to pay any thing, he ſaid, he would none of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, but prayed them to ſwear, if they eſcaped, and he came into danger, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt him to their power; they did ſo. And he taking out a board, ſhewed them the fleet ſailing in, and then ſet them loſe, and went along with them.</p>
               <p>The fleet firſt doubted, hearing nothing: then ſending to <hi>Mercurium,</hi> they were advertiſed of all, and with great joy ſailed on with a ſtrong gale. Which bringing them within 18 miles of <hi>Carthage, Archelaus,</hi> and the land-men, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to caſt anchor, according to the Generals inſtructions. But the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners alleadged the coaſt to be without harbour, and that there was likelyhood of a ſtorm, which kind of ſtorms the natives call <hi>Cypriana;</hi> which falling in that place, they ſhould not be able to ſave a ſhip. And ſo it was indeed: Wherefore ſtriking ſail, and conſulting, they thought not fit to attempt the haven of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dracium,</hi> fearing to break <hi>Beliſarius</hi>'s direction, and ſuſpecting <hi>Mandracium</hi> to be chained up, and beſides, not able to hold the whole fleet; but they thought the Pool to be for their purpoſe (being but five miles from <hi>Carthage,</hi> and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the whole fleet) and to find there no ſtop. So coming thither about even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they caſt anchor, all, ſave <hi>Calonymus,</hi> with ſome mariners; who not regarding the General, put into <hi>Mandracium,</hi> and there robbed ſome Merchants, ſtrangers, and <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> dwelling upon the ſea-ſide.</p>
               <p>The next day <hi>Beliſarius</hi> commanded the men a ſhip-board to land, and with the Army, in order of battel, rode towards <hi>Carthage,</hi> fearing the enemies am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſhes. <q>Here he put the ſoldiers in mind of their good fortunes ſince their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration to the <hi>Africans;</hi> admoniſhing them to continue their good order, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in <hi>Carthage;</hi> That the <hi>Africans</hi> were formerly <hi>Roman</hi> ſubjects, and unwillingly brought under the <hi>Vandals,</hi> from whom they had ſuffered abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable things; That for this, the Emperour made war with the <hi>Vandals;</hi> and that it were impious now to abuſe them, whoſe liberty was the cauſe of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition.</q> Then he entred <hi>Carthage,</hi> none oppoſing; went to the Palace, and ſate down in <hi>Gelimers</hi> Throne. Here the Merchants, and the other <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who dwelt upon the ſea, came in a multitude, and with clamour to <hi>Beliſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> complaining that Mariners the laſt night had robbed them of all they had. He made <hi>Calonymus</hi> ſwear to produce the goods; but he neglecting his oath, went away with the goods then; but afterward at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> by a terrible judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he fell mad, bit out his own tongue, and died. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> then comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his dinner to be, where <hi>Gelimer</hi> uſed to feaſt his great men. The <hi>Romans</hi> from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> call the place <hi>Delphica,</hi> from a three-footed Table ſtanding in the Palace at <hi>Rome,</hi> upon which the Emperours Cup-bearers ſet the cups; which they call <hi>Delphica</hi> (a three-footed table, and firſt uſed at <hi>Delphos</hi>) and ſo in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople;</hi> and whereſoever the Emperours Table ſtands, they call the room <hi>Delphica.</hi> The Emperours houſe alſo they call <hi>Palatium,</hi> of one <hi>Pallas</hi> a Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, who dwelt in that place before the ſack of <hi>Troy,</hi> and built in it a good hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome houſe; where <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> having got the Empire, firſt lodged, and thence they called the Emperours houſe the Palace. Thus <hi>Beliſarius</hi> dined in the <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phica,</hi> and with him the Commanders of the Army. The day before, a dinner was provided for <hi>Gelimer,</hi> and we feaſted upon the meats. <hi>Gelimers</hi> ſervants brought in our dinner, filled our wine, and in all things elſe attended us. Here a man might ſee fortune in her bravery; ſhewing all things to be hers, and that none can call any thing his own. And that day <hi>Beliſarius</hi> attained a glory, which never happened in his own time, nor to any of the ancients. For the ſoldiers uſing not to enter, no not into any <hi>Roman</hi> City, and but 500 together, without ſome diſorder, ſpecially upon the ſodain: This General had his men in ſuch or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,

The publick notaries diſpatcht their writings at the Courts, and took the ſoldiers home with them, as is the manner; and the ſoldiers bought what they liked in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket place, uſing no unquietneſs.</p>

               <p>THen <hi>Beliſarius</hi> gave aſſurances to the <hi>Vandals</hi> fled into the Churches; and took care of the walls of <hi>Carthage,</hi> which had been ſo neglected, that in many places they were eaſily to be mounted, and a great part was quite faln down; which, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> told us, cauſed <hi>Gelimer</hi> not to ſtay in the City; as not able in ſo ſhort a time to ſecure the walls. We heard alſo of an old Propheſie, that had been among the boys in <hi>Carthage.</hi> That <hi>Gamma</hi> ſhould expell <hi>Beta;</hi> and again <hi>Beta</hi> ſhould expell <hi>Gamma.</hi> It was then acounted as an idle riddle among ſporting boys; but now it was clear; for <hi>Genſerick</hi> expelled <hi>Bonifacius,</hi> and now <hi>Beliſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Gelimer.</hi> Then alſo the meaning of a dream was manifeſted, which many had dreamt, and often; not gueſſing at the event. The <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> above all, reverence St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and by the ſea-ſide have dedicated a Church to him cloſe to the City, where they uſe many devotions, and yearly celebrate a feaſt which they call <hi>Cypriana;</hi> and from thence thoſe ſtorms I mentioned, are named, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened about that feaſtival. This Church, in the reign of <hi>Honoricus,</hi> the <hi>Vandals</hi> got, forcing out the Chriſtians and their Prieſts with much indignity; and officiating there themſelves, as now appertaining to the <hi>Arrians.</hi> The <hi>Africans</hi> being much grieved at this, they ſay St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> often appeared to many in their dreams, and bad the Chriſtians not be carefull for him; he would be his own revenger. Which ſaying being divulged; the <hi>Africans</hi> expected the time of puniſhment upon the <hi>Vandals</hi> for theſe devotions; but gueſt not at the event. But now, the Feaſt being to be the next day, and the <hi>Arrian</hi> Prieſts having made clean the Church, hung out their faireſt reliques, prepared the lamps, brought out their treaſures, and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted every thing for the proper uſe. When they heard of the overthrow of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matas</hi> at <hi>Decimum,</hi> away they all ran. And the Orthodox Chriſtians came to the Church, lighted the lamps, and officiated according to their own rites. And ſo the prediction of that viſion was known alſo. The <hi>Vandals</hi> likewiſe remembred an anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſtory, and wondring acknowledged, that to man no expectation is impoſſible, nor no poſſeſſion firm. The ſtory was this. That when the <hi>Vandals</hi> were forced by a famin, to forſake their ancient native Country, yet ſome ſtaid, having no mind to follow <hi>Godigiſclus.</hi> They in time came to have plenty, and <hi>Genſerick</hi> with his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers got <hi>Africk.</hi> Which they were glad to hear, who followed not <hi>Godigiſclus,</hi> finding their Country now able to feed them. And they feared leſt their <hi>African</hi> Plantators or their poſterity, might in time come home upon them again, expelled by the <hi>Romans,</hi> who (they doubted) would not always neglect that Province. So they ſent Ambaſſadors to <hi>Genſerick,</hi> who ſaid unto him, <q>That they congratulated their Countrymens great proſperity, but were no more able to guard their own Country; which they deſpiſing, had planted themſelves in <hi>Africk.</hi> Wherefore they prayed them, if they make no account of their native ſoil, to beſtow on them a poſſeſſion to themſelves uſeleſs. That ſo being abſolute proprietaries of the Country, they might chearfully ſpend their lives for it againſt any invader. <hi>Genſerick</hi> and the <hi>Vandals,</hi> thought this juſt, and yielded to the Ambaſſadors de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.</q> But an old man among them, eſteemed very wiſe, ſaid. <q>He would never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to it; for among men is nothing ſetled upon a ſure foundation; there is no firm and perpetual eſtate in what they have; nor in what they have not, impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</q> 
                  <hi>Genſerick</hi> approved his ſaying, and ſent away the Ambaſſadors with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial: and was then laught at, and his old Counſellor, for foreſeeing things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.</p>

               <p>But upon theſe accidents I have related, the <hi>Vandals</hi> were better inſtructed in humane affairs, and found it the ſpeech of a wiſe man. Of thoſe <hi>Vandals</hi> that ſtaid in their own Countrey, there is no memorial left. They were few, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forced under ſome bordering <hi>Barbarians,</hi> or willingly mingled, and their names drowned in the other. And theſe ſubdued by <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> had no thought of going to their antient Country, having no means ſodainly to paſs into <hi>Europe,</hi> ſpecially their ſhips being gone. But in <hi>Africk</hi> they were puniſhed for the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs done the <hi>Romans;</hi> chiefly the <hi>Zacynthians:</hi> For <hi>Genſerick</hi> infeſting for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly <hi>Peloponeſus,</hi> and attempting <hi>Tenarus,</hi> but repulſed with loſs of many men, and put to a ſhamefull retreat; being angry, ſet upon <hi>Zacynthus,</hi> killed many, made captives of 500 principal men, and then ſailed away; and in the middle of the <hi>Adriatique</hi> ſea, cut thoſe 500 men in pieces, and ſcattered their pieces in the Sea. This was formerly.</p>

               <p>BUt now <hi>Gelimer</hi> by mony and courteous uſage, gained many <hi>African</hi> pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants to undertake the killing of ſuch <hi>Romans</hi> as they found ſtragling; and he proclaimed a ſum of gold upon every killing to the actor. Many ſlaves and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants upon the Army were ſlain, pilfring in the Villages, and their heads were brought to <hi>Gelimer,</hi> for which the peaſants were well paid by him, ſuppoſing to have been rid of ſo many ſoldiers. About this time <hi>Diogenes,</hi> one of <hi>Beliſarius</hi> his life-guard, did very bravely; who ſent him out with 22 of his Targetiers to diſcover the enemy. Theſe men, at a Town two days journy from <hi>Carthage,</hi> the peaſants being not able of themſelves to kill them, advertiſed <hi>Gelimer.</hi> Who ſent againſt them 300 horſe, with direction to bring them alive; he thought it a great matter to have one of <hi>Beliſarius</hi> his life-guard, and 22 of his Targetiers his priſoners. <hi>Diogenes</hi> and his company entred one of the houſes, and in an upper chamber went to bed, hearing the enemy to be farr enough off. The <hi>Vandals</hi> came after midnight, and thought it not good to force into the dores in the night, fearing in the dark they might kill one another, and open a paſſage out for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy. Cowardiſe dul'd their wits; for by uſing fire, or without it, they might have with eaſe taken them, being naked in their beds. So they put themſelves in rank round about the houſe, and chiefly at the dore. In the mean time a <hi>Roman</hi> ſoldier waked, and hearing the noiſe (ſome <hi>Vandals</hi> murmuring to one another, and ſtirring their arms) he gueſt the matter, waked his companions, and ſoftly told them the accident. They, by <hi>Diogenes</hi> direction, quietly put on their cloaths, cook their arms, went down, and bridling their horſes, got up uneſpied. And after a ſhort ſtay in the Court, ſuddenly they open the dores and ſally. The <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals</hi> charged them, but the <hi>Romans</hi> warding with their ſhields, and with their jave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins keeping off the aſſailants, rode away clear; with loſs only of two men. <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ogenes</hi> himſelf had three wounds, one in the neck, into the face another, of which he was within a little of dying; and one upon his left hand, by which he loſt the uſe of his little finger. But in <hi>Carthage, Beliſarius</hi> with mony got artificers, and labourers, and made a Trench, and ſtrong Paliſſadoes round about the walls; and in ſhort time repaired alſo the decaies thereof; a work much admired by the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and afterward by <hi>Gelimer,</hi> being brought thither priſoner. Who wondring at the walls, ſaid, that his negligence therein had been the cauſe of his preſent condition.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Tzazon</hi> the brother of <hi>Gelimer,</hi> arrived with his fleet in <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinia,</hi> at the Port of <hi>Carnalis;</hi> took the Town at the firſt charge, and ſlew <hi>Godas</hi> and his ſoldiers, and hearing that the Emperours fleet was upon the coaſt of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick;</hi> but not what was done, he wrote this Letter to <hi>Gelimer. Know O King of</hi> Vandals <hi>and</hi> Alans, <hi>that</hi> Godas <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper is ſlain by us, and the Iſland again under your Empire; Keep therefore a feſtival of Victory; And hope that the enemy who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes now to invade our Country, ſhal find the ſame fortune, which they had formerly,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50471:58"/>when they invaded our Anceſtors.</hi> The bearers of theſe Letters ſailed into the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of <hi>Carthage</hi> without thought of an enemy, and by the watch being brought to the General, delivered the Letters, and revealed their negotiation; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed to ſee the ſudden change. But from <hi>Beliſarius</hi> they had no hard uſage.</p>
               <p>About the ſame time this happened alſo. Before the coming of our fleet, <hi>Gelimer</hi> had ſent <hi>Gotthaeus,</hi> and <hi>Fuſcias,</hi> and other Ambaſſadors to <hi>Theudis,</hi> Prince of the <hi>Viſigoths</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> for a league.

But now when <hi>Gotthaeus</hi> and his fellows anſwered him, that all was well, he demanded about what they came? They propounding a League, <hi>Theudis</hi> bad them go to the ſea-ſide; and there you ſhall know certainly your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs at home. The Ambaſſadors taking it for the idle ſpeech of a man in drink, replyed not. But the next day again propounding the League, and again <hi>Theu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> uſing the ſame words, they thought there was ſome alteration in <hi>Africk;</hi> but not imagining any thing of <hi>Carthage,</hi> they ſailed thither, and landing near it, fell among the ſoldiers, and yielded; and were brought to the General, and told him their buſineſs, and had no hurt from him.</p>

Some of them ſent their ſons for hoſtages, and deſired him to ſend them their Enſignes of Principality, according to the ancient cuſtom; which was, that none might rule <hi>Moors,</hi> before he had thoſe Enſignes ſent by the Emperour, though he were an enemy to the <hi>Romans;</hi> And having them now from the <hi>Vandals,</hi> they thought not their Government firm. The Enſignes are, a ſilver Rod gilt, a ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Cap, not covering the whole head, but like a Garland, and kept upright with ſilver wire round about: A white Mantle alſo, faſtened with a golden Claſp over the right ſhoulder, in the manner of a <hi>Theſſalian</hi> Mantle: A white Robe embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and a gilt ſhoe. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> ſent all theſe unto them, and mony alſo, but they did not joyn with him, nor yet durſt ſtand for the <hi>Vandals,</hi> but kept aloof, watching the event of the war.</p>

They quartered themſelves in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Towns, and thought to block up the City ſo, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting guards upon the high-ways. They uſed no ſpoyl nor pillage, aſſuming the Country as their own: and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting ſome Treaſon by the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and ſuch <hi>Roman</hi> ſoldiers as were <hi>Arrians.</hi> With large promiſes alſo, they invited the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the <hi>Hunns</hi> to be their friends and confederates: They, who were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected to the <hi>Romans,</hi> alleadging that <hi>Peter,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> General, had brought them to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> againſt their wills, and contrary to his expreſs oath. So they entertained the motion, and agreed in the battel to turn their powers againſt the <hi>Romans.</hi> Of all this <hi>Beliſarius</hi> had ſome ſuſpition, by relation of ſome fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitives;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50471:60"/>and the walls being not wholly finiſhed, he would not ſally, but accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated all things within. He crucified one <hi>Laurus</hi> a <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> for Treaſon, upon a hillock before the City, convinced by his own Secretary; which frighted the reſt from the like attempts The <hi>Maſſagetes</hi> courting with gifts, and invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to his table, and other complements, at laſt he got out of them what <hi>Geli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> had promiſed them, to turn cowards in the battel; and indeed that they had no mind to fight, fearing that, the <hi>Vandals</hi> being overthrown, the <hi>Romans</hi> would not diſmiſs them to their own Country, but wear them out in <hi>Africk;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, take their booty from them. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> ſware to them, that they ſhould be ſent home ſo ſoon as the <hi>Vandals</hi> were abſolutely overthrown, with all their boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and bound them by oath to aid us with all alacrity. Then, all things being well prepared he ſpake thus to the Army. <q>To uſe exhortations of courage to you, may ſeem needleſs fellow-ſoldiers! who have already ſo vanquiſht the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, that <hi>Carthage</hi> and all <hi>Africk</hi> is the purchaſe of your valour:</q> and <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi> never have faint hearts. But it is not unſeaſonable to put you in mind, <q>that fighting bravely now the <hi>Vandals</hi> will have an end of their hopes, and we of fighting. You ought then chearfully and with pleaſure to enter into this combat; being to be the period of your labours: And let none ſpeak of the <hi>Vandals</hi> multitude; which uſes not to determine wars, but mens valour. Let the moſt powerfull thing among men, a ſenſe of reputation upon your former acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons affect you: it being a ſhame for men in their wits, to grow worſe, and to leſſen their own virtue. The enemy their fear, and remembrance of misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes will make cowards; the one frighting with things paſt, the other expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling hope of victory; ill fortune ever inſtantly dejecting mens ſpirirs. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, our combat is for greater things. If the former fight had ſucceeded ill, our danger had been, not to conquer anothers Country: But now we loſe that which is our own, if we be not victorious.

You have in your hands the concluſion of this war; if you neglect it, and put off opportunity, you will ſeek it when 'tis gone. Fortune deſpiſed, ſtops; eſpecially if the judgements be improved of thoſe ſhe favoured not before. That Goddeſs hates ſuch as ſquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der away their proſperity. And if any man imagine that the fight of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies wives and children, and moſt precious things, will make them dare even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond power, he errs.

But if we vanquiſh we ſhall live in proſperity, and after an honorable death, leave our Families happy, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the <hi>Vandals</hi> name and Empire. If ever men fought a battel for all they have, and for the hopes of all men, we are they.

Then to ſee the howlings of theſe women, and theſe weeping children, even ſtops my ſpeech, with the extream grief: ſo that I will only ſay this: That theſe our deareſt pledges we ſhall never more ſee, if we vanquiſh not our enemies.

And if you be valiant to day, the depoſition of <hi>Godas</hi> will clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear an effect of your valour; but if now you faint, you will loſe the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alſo of that action. And we have the advantage over the reſt; terrified with their former defeat; we being unvanquiſht, and fighting with a courage untainted. Then will the greateſt part of the garland of victory be yours, you will be called the Preſervers of the <hi>Vandal</hi> Nation: for by winning in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of men formerly unfortunate, you will appropriate to your ſelves the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fortune. Upon theſe conſiderations you may do well to ſtint the howling of your women and children, and calling God to your aſſiſtance, to march boldly againſt the enemy in the head of your Countrymen.</q>

                  <hi>Gelimer</hi> and <hi>Tzazon,</hi> after theſe exhortations, drew them out; and about noon came on (the <hi>Romans</hi> being preparing their dinners) and ſtood in order up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the banks of the brook there. On the other bank the <hi>Romans</hi> put alſo in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thus; The left wing <hi>Martinus, Valerianus, John, Cyprian, Althias,</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi> had, and the other Commanders of Confederates: The right wing <hi>Pap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus, Barbatus,</hi> and <hi>Aigan,</hi> and the Captains of the <hi>Legionary</hi> horſe. In the midſt ſtood <hi>John,</hi> with the Generals <hi>Lanciers,</hi> and Enſigne; and thither in the due ſeaſon came <hi>Beliſarius</hi> himſelf, leaving the foot behind, marching fair and ſoftly. The <hi>Hunns</hi> who uſed before not to mingle their ranks with the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, then ſtood aloof, with the intention I have ſaid. The <hi>Vandals</hi> order was,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50471:61"/>to diſtribute each wing among the Colonels of thouſands, every one leading his proper Regiment: And in the middle ſtood <hi>Tzazon;</hi> and in the rear the <hi>Moors. Gelimer</hi> himſelf rode about from place to place, to encourage his ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: Whom he warned in this fight, not to uſe Javelins, nor any weapons but their ſwords. It was long ere they began. Then <hi>John,</hi> by <hi>Beliſarius</hi> his direction, with a few choſen men, paſſed the brook, and charged thoſe in the middle; where <hi>Tzazon</hi> repulſed him back towards the main Army, purſuing him to the brooks ſide, but not going over. Again <hi>John</hi> drawing out more Targetiers of <hi>Beliſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> rode againſt <hi>Tzazon;</hi> and being again repulſed, retired. He renewed the charge the third time, with almoſt all <hi>Beliſarius</hi> his Targetiers and Lanciers, and the Generals Enſigne, ſhouting and claſhing their arms. The <hi>Barbarians</hi> valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received them, uſing their ſwords only; and the fight grew ſtiff, where many <hi>Vandals,</hi> and of the beſt, were ſlain, and <hi>Tzazon</hi> himſelf. Then came on the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Cavalry, and paſſing the brook, charged the enemy. And the defeat, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the middle, appeared clearly; each one routing their oppoſites with eaſe. Which the <hi>Maſſagetes</hi> perceiving, according to their reſolution they followed the execution with the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, which laſted not long; the <hi>Vandals</hi> recovering their Camp; and the <hi>Romans</hi> not holding themſelves able to fight with them in their entrenchment, ſtript ſuch dead bodies as had any gold upon them, and retired to their Camp. In this fight were ſlain of <hi>Romans</hi> 50. and of <hi>Vandals</hi> 800. But <hi>Beliſarius</hi> about the evening (his foot being come up) marcht with his whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the <hi>Vandals</hi> Camp. <hi>Gelimer</hi> ſeeing <hi>Beliſarius</hi> with his foot, and all marching, without one word ſpeaking, or giving any direction, leapt on horſeback and fled the way into <hi>Numidia;</hi> his kinſmen, and ſome few houſhold ſervants following him, amazed, and concealing what it was for. Some time the <hi>Vandals</hi> knew not of <hi>Gelimers</hi> flight; but when they found it, and ſaw the enemy, the men were in a tumult; the women howled, the children cryed; none ſought to ſave their goods, nor regarded the lamentations of their deareſt friends; But every man in confuſion ran away. The <hi>Romans</hi> took the Camp, with all the wealth in it, and deſtitute of men: And following the chaſe all night, killed the men they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took, and made ſlaves of the women and children. They found in the Camp ſo great a maſs of wealth, as was never together in a place. For the <hi>Vandals</hi> had long ranſackt the <hi>Roman</hi> Provinces, and brought much wealth into <hi>Africk;</hi> which being alſo good land, and moſt plentifull of all commodities; the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues in mony were not ſpent in other Countrys, but put up by the owners for the ſpace of 95 years,<note place="margin">An.

               <p>BUt <hi>Beliſarius</hi> was troubled to ſee the <hi>Romans</hi> diſorder, and all night was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, leſt the <hi>Vandals</hi> making head again, might ruine them. If they had come, not one <hi>Roman</hi> had eſcaped to enjoy their booty. For the ſoldiers, being of a ſudden become maſters of ſo great wealth, and of perſonages extreamly beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, could not contain, nor find any ſatiety in their booty. They were drunk with their proſperity, and would have every man returned to <hi>Carthage,</hi> carrying all along with them. And they ſtragled by one and by two, as their hope of gain led them, ſearching in woods and faſtneſſes, and in caves and ſuch places, ſubject to danger, and ambuſhes, fearing no enemy, nor reſpecting <hi>Beliſarius;</hi> being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with nothing but the deſire of booty. Which <hi>Beliſarius</hi> ſeeing, he knew not what order to take. And ſo ſoon as it was day, he ſtood upon a hillock by the high way, calling upon them for order, and chiding the ſoldiers and commanders. Such as came that way, ſent their booty and captives with their Comrades to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage;</hi> and themſelves repaired to the General, and obeyed his directions. He
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50471:61"/>commanded <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Armenian,</hi> to follow <hi>Gelimer</hi> without intermiſſion, and to take him alive or dead. And he wrote to his friends in <hi>Carthage,</hi> to take the <hi>Vandals</hi> out of the Churches in Towns thereabout, giving them aſſurances and to diſarm them that they might not ſtir, and to keep them ſafe in the City till his coming. With the troops he had, he went about recollecting the Army, and giving aſſurances to ſuch <hi>Vandals</hi> as he found, there being none but in Churches; whom he diſarmed, and ſent under guards to <hi>Carthage,</hi> giving them no time to make head. All being ſetled, he marcht with the reſt of his Army againſt <hi>Geli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. John</hi> following the chace five days together, came very near to <hi>Gelimer;</hi> who being not ordained to be taken by <hi>John,</hi> this croſs chance happened. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the purſuers with <hi>John,</hi> was one <hi>

The ſixth day of their purſuit, being in drink, he ſpied about Sun-riſing a bird upon a tree, and let fly an arrow at it. He miſt the bird; but ſhot <hi>John</hi> behind in the neck; who ſoon after dyed of the wound; leaving a great miſs both to the General and Emperour, and all, both <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> He was a valiant, and a virtuous man, and bore himſelf mildly and moderately to all men.

This mountain is ſteep, and very ill way; high rocks ſtanding round about it. In it inhabit <hi>Barbarian Moors,</hi> friends and confederates of <hi>Gelimer;</hi> and on the utmoſt border of it, ſtands an antient City, named <hi>Medenos.</hi> Here <hi>Gelimer</hi> with his company reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

How ſtrange a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding is it, to ſuffer</hi> Gelimer <hi>to hold the Caſtle, and from the Emperour, Gelimers Maſter, to take away his ſlaves poſſeſſions? Take heed: conſider how friendſhip co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers many grievances: but an enemy endures not the leaſt injury, but looks back, and will not wink at his foe grown rich, whence he ſhould not; But then he alleadges the wrongs done to his Anceſtors; then he fights; wherein though he fail, yet he loſes no poſſeſſion; but proſpering, makes the vanquiſhed ask forgiveneſs. Do you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do us no farther ill, nor ſuffer any. Make not the Emperour an enemy to the</hi> Goths, <hi>whom you wiſh propitious.

And three winter-moneths were ſpent in this ſiege; And <hi>Gelimer</hi> feared that ere long they would get up to him; He ſaw the children of his kin even ſwarm with lice; full of ſorrow he was, weary of the thought of any thing but dying; yet he endured all beyond imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, till he ſaw this ſight. A <hi>Mooriſh</hi> woman had pounded ſome wheat, and thereof made a little Cake, which ſhe threw in the hot aſhes upon the hearth, as the <hi>Moors</hi> uſe to bake then bread: Two hungry boyes, (one the ſaid womans ſon, and the other <hi>Gelimers</hi> ſiſters ſon) watcht at the hearth to catch the cake when it was baked: The <hi>Vandale</hi> boy caught it firſt, and hungerly thruſt it hot into his mouth, with the aſhes on; the other boy took him by the hair, and with beating forced him to put out the cake again. <hi>Gelimer,</hi> who obſerved all this accident, could not beare it, but relented, and preſently wrote thus to <hi>Pharas.</hi>
                  <q>If ever man endured miſery with a ſucceſs quite contrary to his counſels, ſuch am I, Excellent <hi>Pharas!</hi> I mean not to neglect your good advice; being no longer able to ſtrive with fortune, nor ſtruggle under the yoke of deſtiny, which I will follow as it pleaſes the ſame to lead me. Let me have aſſurance of <hi>Beliſarius</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking the performance of that by the Emperour, which you lately intimated, and I will immediately render my ſelf to you, and all my kindred, and <hi>Vandals</hi> here with me.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pharas</hi> acquainted <hi>Beliſarius</hi> with this, and the former Letters; deſiring to know his pleaſure. Who much deſiring to bring <hi>Gelimer</hi> alive to the Emperour, and overjoyed with the news, inſtantly ſent to <hi>Pappua, Cyprian</hi> Commander of the Confederates, with ſome others, to give oath to <hi>Gelimer</hi> for the ſafety of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and company, and that he ſhould have an honourable rank with the Emperor, and want nothing. And they with <hi>Pharas</hi> went to the foot of the mountain, whither came <hi>Gelimer,</hi> received the aſſurances as he deſired, and went with them to <hi>Carthage. Beliſarius</hi> was in a ſuburb thereof, named <hi>Aclae:</hi> where <hi>Gelimer</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſented, fell a laughing openly, that ſome imagined him to be diſtracted through the extremity of his miſery: But his friends alleadged the man to be of ſudden apprehenſion; He was royally born, and a King; and now from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued power and wealth, fallen into bondage and fear; And after his enduring ſo much in <hi>Pappua,</hi> he muſt now be ranked amongſt ſlaves; And thus having had experience of Fortunes ſmiles and frowns, he thought Humane condition to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve only laughter. Thus they conceived of it. But <hi>Beliſarius</hi> acquainted the Emperour how <hi>Gelimer</hi> was a Captive at <hi>Carthage,</hi> and prayed leave to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him to <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> keeping him in the mean time in an honorable reſtraint, and preparing his Fleet. Many experiments the world hath ſeen beyond hope, and many it will, while Fortune continues the ſame. Many things ſeeming to Reaſon impoſſible, have come to paſs, and been wondred at: But I know not whether ever the like of theſe things hath happened. For a fourth Succeſſor of <hi>Genſerick</hi> (his Kingdom flouriſhing with wealth and men of war) to be ruined in ſo ſhort a time, by 5000 new comers without a place to anchor in, (ſo many only were the Horſe, who by their valour or fortune debated the whole war) is juſtly to be wondred at. But I return from whence I digreſſed; This being the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the <hi>Vandal</hi> wars.</p>

               <p>But ſome Commanders being envious of <hi>Beliſarius</hi> (as is uſual in great felicities) traduced him without any colour of truth, to the Emperour, of uſurpation. The Emperour made no ſhew of it, either deſpiſing the accuſation, or thinking it his beſt way; and ſent thither <hi>Solomon,</hi> and gave <hi>Beliſarius</hi> his choice, either to come to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> with <hi>Gelimer</hi> and the <hi>Vandals,</hi> or to ſtay and ſend them. But he (who was not ignorant how the Commanders charged him with uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) urged to go to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to cleer the imputation, and to be revenged of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50471:63"/>his accuſers. He came to diſcover the plot againſt him thus. His accuſers fearing the miſcarriage of their letters to the Emperour, and ſo to ſpoil their deſign, wrote of the uſurpation in two letters, by ſeveral meſſengers in ſeveral ſhips; one where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſailed away uneſpied; but the other upon ſome ſuſpition was taken in <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dracium,</hi> and his letter intercepted, and the plot diſcovered to <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> who thereupon made haſte to get to the Emperours preſence. But the <hi>Moors</hi> of <hi>By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zacium</hi> and <hi>Numidia,</hi> breaking their truce, revolted, and ſuddenly made war up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Romans,</hi> without any occaſion at all: An action agreeable to their diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions; for with <hi>Moors</hi> is no care of oaths, nor hoſtages, (though of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, brethren, or Rulers) neither any aſſured peace, but by their feare of the enemy. They made truce with <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> and broke it, as I ſhall tell you. The Emperours Fleet being expected in <hi>Africk,</hi> the <hi>Moors</hi> afraid, reſorted to their ſoothſaying women, it being not lawfull for their men to ſoothſay. Theſe women after being poſſeſſed with a Spirit, as was uſual for them, according to the manner of the ancient Oracles; foretold an Army from the waters, the ruine of the <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals,</hi> and deſtruction of the <hi>Moors,</hi> when a Generall of <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould come without a beard. Upon this anſwer the <hi>Moors,</hi> ſeeing the Fleet at ſea, were afraid, and would not aſſiſt the <hi>Vandals;</hi> but ſent to <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> and made a peace, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the ſucceſs. And the buſineſs of the <hi>Vandals</hi> being diſpatcht, they ſent to ſpie in the Roman Army if there were any Commander without a beard; And finding all well ſtored with beards, they thought (as they would have it) the Oracle to concern ſome after-ages, and not them. So they long'd to break the truce, but were afraid of <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> deſpairing of overcoming the <hi>Romans,</hi> he being with them. And hearing him to be ready to go, and his Lanciers, Targetiers, and <hi>Vandal</hi> Captives to be already on ſhip-board, they took arms ſuddenly, and did the <hi>Africans</hi> much miſchief: For the Souldiers being diſperſed in ſmall gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons upon the borders, and unprepared, could not every where oppoſe, nor hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Barbarians</hi> inroads, which were often, and ſecret. And ſo men in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion were ſlain, women and children made ſlaves, goods every where carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and all the Country full of flights. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> was at ſea when he heard of this, and could not come back now; but he appointed <hi>Solomon</hi> to govern <hi>Africk,</hi> and to take the moſt part of his Targetiers and Lanciers, and to chaſtiſe the <hi>Moors</hi> for this wrong to the <hi>Romans.</hi> Another Army the Emperor ſent to <hi>Solomon,</hi> with <hi>Theodorus</hi> the <hi>Cappadocian,</hi> and <hi>Ildeger,</hi> who married the daughter of <hi>Antonina, Beliſarius</hi> his wife. And the ancient <hi>African</hi> tributes being not to be found up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ancient <hi>Roman</hi> records there, which <hi>Genſerick</hi> had deſtroyed; <hi>Tryphon</hi> and <hi>Euſtratius</hi> were ſent with commiſſion from the Emperour to make a taxe; Men whom the <hi>Africans</hi> found harſh and intolerable.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Beliſarius</hi> being arrived at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> with <hi>Gelimer</hi> and the <hi>Vandals,</hi> was thought worthy of thoſe ancient honours given to Generals for the greateſt victories. It is about 600 years ſince any had the ſame, unleſs it were <hi>Titus, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>janus,</hi> and ſuch Emperours, as led the Army in perſon, and got victory of ſome <hi>Barbarian</hi> nation. He led the ſpoils, and priſoners of war, in pomp through the City; which the <hi>Romans</hi> call a Triumph; but it was not in the ancient manner: He went afoot from his own houſe to the <hi>Circus,</hi> and there from his Pavillion to the Emperours throne. The ſpoils were things belonging to the ſervice of the King, and Gold-chains, and the Chariots for his Queen, with many Jewels &amp; Cups of gold, and all things uſeful at a Kings feaſt. Silver alſo weighing many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand talents and a huge maſs of Royal furniture, (<hi>Genſerick</hi> having ſackt, as I ſaid, the Palace at <hi>Rome</hi>) among which were ſome monuments of the Jewes, brought to <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Titus,</hi> after the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> A Jew there eſpy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame, ſtanding by one of the Emperours familiar friends, <hi>It is not ſo good</hi> (quoth he) <hi>to bring theſe monuments into the Palace of</hi> Conſtantinople; <hi>for they cannot continue but where</hi> Solomon <hi>firſt placed them: Hence it is that</hi> Genſerick <hi>ſackt the Palace in</hi> Rome, <hi>and now</hi> Beliſarius <hi>that of the</hi> Vandals. The Emperour hearing this, ſent them to the Chriſtian Churches in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> The Captives were, <hi>Gelimer,</hi> bearing a Purple robe, and all his kindred, and the talleſt and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifulleſt of the <hi>Vandals. Gelimer</hi> ſeeing the Emperour ſitting upon a high throne, and the people on both ſides in the <hi>Circus,</hi> and himſelf in that calamity, uſed no
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50471:64"/>lamentation, but ſtill repeated that in the Scripture, <hi>Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.</hi> Being at the Emperours throne, they took from him the Purple robe, and cauſed him to fall upon his face and adore the Emperour. The ſame did <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating for him to the Emperour: who, with his Empreſs <hi>Theodora,</hi> gave large means to <hi>Ildericks</hi> children, and the deſcendants of <hi>Valentinian;</hi> and to <hi>Gelimer</hi> they gave towns in <hi>Galatia</hi> of good value, where they ſuffered him to dwell. He would not change his <hi>Arrian</hi> Religion; ſo he was not admitted a <hi>Patrician. Beliſarius</hi> not long after had a Triumph according to the ancient cuſtom. Going to be inſtalled <hi>Conſul,</hi> he was born by Captives in a chariot, from whence he threw of the <hi>Vandal</hi> ſpoils among the people, ſilver-veſſels, and gold-belts, and much more of the <hi>Vandals</hi> wealth. And then men ſaw things forgotten, thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed by time.</p>

Which the <hi>Barbarian</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>Cutzînas, Eſdilâſas, Juphrûthes,</hi> and <hi>Mediſiniſſas</hi> hearing, ſet upon them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout evening; whom the <hi>Romans,</hi> being few, and ſurpriſed in the narrow paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, in the midſt of thouſands, were not able to reſiſt; which way ſoever they turned the enemy having their backs. <hi>Ruſinus</hi> and <hi>Aigan</hi> ran to a rock, and thence kept off the enemy with their arrows; who durſt not come up, but darted their Javelins. Their arrows being ſpent, the <hi>Moors</hi> came to handy blowes, and they awhile defended themſelves with their ſwords; but numbers overpreſſing, cut <hi>Aigan</hi> in pieces, and carried away <hi>Rufinus.</hi> But <hi>Mediſiniſſas,</hi> fearing he might eſcape, and trouble them again, took off his head, and ſhewed it at home to his wives; being for bigneſs, and abundance of hair, a goodly ſight.</p>
               <p>It is not amiſs to ſay ſomething here, how, and from whence the <hi>Moors</hi> came originally to inhabit <hi>Africk.</hi> When the <hi>Hebrews</hi> came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> was dead, and <hi>Joſhua</hi> his ſucceſſor, with more then humane valour, had brought the people into <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> poſſeſt the Country, overthrown the Nations, conquered their Cities, and was thought invincible: The <hi>Gergeſites</hi> and <hi>Jebuſites,</hi> and other Nations, mentioned in the Scripture (being populous, and inhabiting the ſea-coaſt, from <hi>Sidon</hi> to <hi>Egypt,</hi> called <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> and under one King, as is confeſſed by all Writers of Antiquities) ſeeing this new Captain unreſiſtible, they removed from their own Country into <hi>Egypt.</hi> Where finding no room, (<hi>Egypt</hi> being antiently populous) they went on into <hi>Africk:</hi> and building many Cities, poſſeſt it all, unto <hi>Hercules</hi> Pillars, and to this day continue there, uſing the <hi>Phoenician</hi> language. In <hi>Numidia</hi> they built a Caſtle, where now is the City of <hi>Tigiſis.</hi> In which ſtand two Pillars, near the great Conduit, with theſe words engraven in the <hi>Phoenician</hi> language. <hi>We are they who fled from before</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua <hi>the chief, the ſon of</hi> Nun. Other people antiently inhabited <hi>Africk,</hi> and therefore were ſaid to be born of the earth. Whereupon their King, <hi>Antoeus,</hi> (who wraſtled with <hi>Hercules</hi> in <hi>Clypea</hi>) was called the ſon of the earth. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the <hi>Phaenicians</hi> came with <hi>Dido</hi> into <hi>Africk,</hi> to thoſe of the ſame race, who received them and permitted them to build <hi>Carthage.</hi> But in time, the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi> grown great and populous, overcame theſe <hi>Moors</hi> in battel, who came
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50471:64"/>thus out of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> and forced them to inhabit far from <hi>Carthage.</hi> And the <hi>Romans</hi> afterward being Maſters of the world, planted the <hi>Moors</hi> upon the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt borders of the inhabited Countrys of <hi>Africk,</hi> and made the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> and other <hi>Africans</hi> Tributary. But lately the <hi>Moors</hi> got many victories of the <hi>Vandals,</hi> and held <hi>Mauritania,</hi> extending from <hi>Caliz</hi> to <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> and the moſt part of <hi>Africk</hi> beſide.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Solomon</hi> underſtanding the accident of <hi>Aigan,</hi> and <hi>Rufinus,</hi> prepared for a War, and wrote this Letter to the Princes of the <hi>Moors.</hi> 
                  <q>Others heretofore have ventured fooliſhly, and periſht, not divining the event of their preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But you, ſeeing a preſident of your neighbours the <hi>Vandals,</hi> upon what madneſs have you drawn your ſwords againſt the great Emperour? and do thus abandon your ſafeties, after ſolemn oaths, and your ſons given for pledges? Is it to ſhew that you regard neither God, faith, kindred, nor ſafety? Being ſuch, in what God can you truſt for help, provoking a <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour? You have loſt your ſons; for what is it you mean to hazard? If you repent for what is paſt, write that you will give over; If not, expect a <hi>Roman</hi> war to come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, with your violated oaths, and the undoing your own ſons.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Moors</hi> made this anſwer to <hi>Solomon.</hi>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Beliſarius</hi> perſwaded us with large promiſes, to obey the Emperour. But now affording us no ſhare of your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, you would have us friends and aids ſtill, ſtarving with hunger. It is you are the faith-breakers, not the <hi>Moors:</hi> Not they, who fly off from their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociates upon wrongs, violate Truces, but they who demand Truce, and then oppreſs men: Not they, who fight for their own, make God their enemy; but who uſurping other mens right, dare hazard a war. Concerning ſons, you may be troubled, who muſt have but one wife: We who may have 50 wives at once, can never want a generation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Upon this, <hi>Solomon</hi> reſolved to lead his Army againſt them; and having diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of things in <hi>Carthage,</hi> marcht into <hi>Byzacium,</hi> and encamped at <hi>Mamme,</hi> near the aforeſaid <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Princes.</p>

               <p>AT the foot of high mountains there, upon a plain piece of ground, the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians</hi> put their battel in order to fight, thus. They put their Camels in a round (as <hi>Cabaon</hi> did formerly) made their front 12. Camels deep, and placed their women and children in the middle, ſave ſome few, who made their entrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and cabbins; dreſt their horſes and Camels, and their own diet, and did many ſervices in their fights. Themſelves ſtood between the Camels legs, having ſhields, ſwords, and Javelins; and ſome horſe upon the mountains. Half the Round next the mountain, <hi>Solomon</hi> omitted; fearing leſt the enemy from thence, and from the Round might charge his men at once, and ſo get their backs, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Army to the reſt, and finding them dejected with the accident of <hi>Aigan</hi> and <hi>Rufinus,</hi> he made them this ſpeech to encourage them. You that are fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <q>ſoldiers of <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> are not to fear, nor make it an example, if 50000 <hi>Moors</hi> have vanquiſht 500 <hi>Romans.</hi> Call to mind your own valour: Think how the <hi>Vandals</hi> vanquiſht the <hi>Moors,</hi> and with what eaſe you are now Maſters of the <hi>Vandals;</hi> and having beaten the better men, will you fear the weaker? The <hi>Moors</hi> are the pooreſt Nation to fight in the world, coming naked, or with ſhort ſhields only, ill made, and unable to keep out a blow, and ſuch men, as when they have thrown out their two Javelins, if they do no effect, run inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly away: So that we may by warding their firſt fury, have the better with eaſe, your advantage in your arms, valour, ſtrength of body, experience in battels, and confidence, for having been already victorious over every enemy, you are to conſider. All which the <hi>Moors</hi> wanting truſt only to their multitude, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no ſoldiers, are the more eaſily beaten by a few well prepared. The ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er hath his confidence in himſelf: but the coward is commonly diſtreſſed by
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50471:65"/>his croud of aſſiſtants. And theſe Camels deſerve your contempt, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reſiſt us, and being wounded by us (as they ſhall) will put theſe men in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order. Their preſumption upon their former good fortune, will fight for you. For boldneſs meaſured by ones power, may be an advantage: but exceeding that, it runs him into danger. Which conſidering, and not valuing the enemy, you ſhall ſilently, and with eaſe vanquiſh him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Princes of the <hi>Moors</hi> alſo, ſeeing their men amazed at the <hi>Romans</hi> order, uſed this encouragement. <q>You have found, fellow ſoldiers I that theſe <hi>Romans</hi> have but the bodies of men, having killed ſome of their beſt men, overwhelmed with our Javelins, and taken many of them priſoners. Then have we a great advantage in numbers: And our ſtrife is about the greateſt things, either to be Maſters of <hi>Africk,</hi> or ſlaves of theſe braggarts. So that now hazarding for all, if we be not more then ordinarily valiant, we ſhall do no good. And let us not regard their arming, which combers their foot, then whom the <hi>Moors</hi> will be much the ſwifter. And their horſe will be diſordered by the ſight of our Camels, and by their cries, louder then the noiſe of the battel. To think the enemy unreſiſtible becauſe of his victory of the <hi>Vandals,</hi> is an errour. The Generals vertue ever poiſes the battel: and <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> the greateſt cauſe of that victory, fortune hath removed: Beſides, the <hi>Vandals</hi> we had weakened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and made them an eaſie conqueſt to the <hi>Romans:</hi> And if we do valiantly now, we ſhall be Maſters of theſe men alſo.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This exhortation ended, the battel begun. At firſt the <hi>Romans</hi> were put into confuſion by their horſes skittiſhneſs at the ſight and cry of the Camels, throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their riders, and running away, and by the <hi>Moors</hi> incurſions, darting the Javelins they had: ſo that being frighted and in tumult, they neither defended, nor kept their ranks. Which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſeeing, leapt from his horſe, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the reſt to do the like, and to ſtand ſtill, warding with their ſhields, againſt the enemies Javelins, and to keep their orders. Himſelf with 500 men gave on upon the Round; directing to kill the Camels. The <hi>Moors</hi> there ran away, and ſome 200 Camels were killed. Which being done, the Round was to be entred, and the <hi>Romans</hi> pierced into the midſt of it, where the <hi>Moors</hi> wives were. The <hi>Barbarians</hi> all amazed, ran up the mountain, whom the <hi>Romans</hi> purſuing, killed ſome 10000 of them, flying in confuſion. The Camels ſurviving were taken: and the <hi>Romans</hi> marcht to <hi>Carthage,</hi> to keep their Feaſt of Victory.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Barbarians</hi> grown angry, made an univerſal invaſion, leaving none behind. Firſt they overran <hi>Byzacium,</hi> ſparing no age they could catch. <hi>Solomon</hi> was new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come to <hi>Carthage,</hi> when this news was told him. So that he marcht againſt them with the whole Army; and at the mountain of <hi>Burgaon,</hi> upon which the <hi>Moors</hi> encamped, he ſate down, expecting the <hi>Moors</hi> deſcent, that he might give them battel upon plain ground. But ſeeing them not come down, he put the Army in a fair order to fight. But they watched their occaſions in the mountain, being heartily afraid of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and having no mind to fight in a champian. <hi>Burgaon</hi> is moſt of it very ragged; and to the Eaſt inacceſſible; but to the Weſt paſſable; and riſing gently; and between two rocks is a deep woody Valley. The top of the mountain, where they expected no enemy, they left without men; and they quitted the foot of it, which was eaſie of acceſs; and encamped in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, to have the ſhooting of the enemies heads from above. And they had hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, either to run away with, or to chaſe, if they got the day: <hi>Solomon</hi> ſeeing the <hi>Moors</hi> would not yet come to the even ground, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Army weary in that deſert place, made haſte to fight. But finding the ſoldier diſmayed atheir enemies multitude, much greater then in the former battel; he ſpake thus to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The enemies fear of you needs no accuſer nor witneſs; it convinces it ſelf. So many thouſands not daring to encounter you upon even ground; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no confidence in themſelves, but making this faſtneſs their refuge: So that exhortations in words are needleſs to you, whom the things themſelves, and your enemies weakneſs animates: Only let me put you in mind, that by the proſperous concluſion of this day, you will inſtantly enjoy all the wealth of <hi>Africk;</hi> the <hi>Vandals</hi> being overcome, and the <hi>Moors</hi> reduced, and no enemy

                  <hi>Solomon</hi> having thus ſaid, commanded <hi>Theodorus</hi> the Scout-Maſter, to draw out 1000 foot, with their Enſignes, about the evening, and cloſely to get up at the Eaſt ſide of <hi>Burgaon,</hi> where the mountain is moſt difficult, and being come to the top, to paſs the night without noiſe; and with Sun-riſing to ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the enemy, diſplaying their Enſignes, and to ſhoot at them. He did accordingly, and at mid-night, paſſing up a ragged way near the rock, was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcerned by <hi>Moors</hi> nor <hi>Romans;</hi> being ſaid to be ſent to ly abroad, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent miſchief to the Camp. Before break of day <hi>Solomon</hi> went to the skirt of the hill, toward the enemy; and the ſoldiers, when the day grew bright, ſeeing the top of the mountain, full of men diſplaying <hi>Roman</hi> Enſignes, were amazed. When they on the top, began the fight, the <hi>Romans</hi> perceived them to be their own; and the <hi>Barbarians</hi> finding themſelves ſhot on both ſides, and without means to drive off the enemy, they deſpaired and ran away. But daring to fly neither to the top nor bottom of the hill, being both poſſeſſed by the enemy; they ran amain to the woody Valley, ſome on horſe-back, ſome afoot. And being a multitude, and in fear, and tumult, they killed one another, and falling in to the Valley very deep, the foremoſt were ſlain, and not diſcerned by them that followed. But when the Valley was full of horſes and dead bodies, the reſidue were ſaved, paſſing over the bodies from <hi>Burgaon</hi> to the other rock. The ſurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers affirmed 50 thouſand <hi>Moors</hi> to have been ſlain in this overthrow. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> loſt not a man, nor ſo much as received a wound from the enemy, nor other accident, but all enjoyed the victory untoucht. The <hi>Barbarians</hi> Princes eſcaped all, ſave <hi>Iſdilaſas,</hi> who upon promiſe of life, yielded himſelf priſoner. Their boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of women and children was ſo great, that they ſold a <hi>Mooriſh</hi> boy for the price of a ſheep. The <hi>Moors</hi> remaining, then remembred the womens Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, That their Nation ſhould periſh by a man without a beard.</p>

                  </gap>000 men, and made ſlaves of many <hi>Africans. Althias</hi> then had the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of a Caſtle thereabout, who having a mind to reſcue ſome of thoſe captives, drew out 70 <hi>Hunns</hi> of his Gariſon; but not conceiving it poſſible with ſuch a number to ſtand the multitude of the <hi>Moors,</hi> he would have poſſeſt ſome nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row paſſage, where the enemy marching, he might have ſeized upon the captives. But finding all open champian about the Towns there, he reſolved to poſſeſs a great well ſtanding in <hi>Tigiſis,</hi> an unwalled City, but in a great faſtneſs; thinking that the enemy being thirſty, would certainly come thither, no other water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near. The great odds in numbers cauſed his conceit herein to ſavour of mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The <hi>Moors</hi> having toiled in the ſummer heats, and being extream thirſty, ran to the well, imagining no oppoſition: But finding the place poſſeſt by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, they ſtood amazed, being faint, and longing for water. <hi>Jabdas</hi> therefore came to a parly with <hi>Althias,</hi> and offered the third part of his booty, that his <hi>Moors</hi> might drink, which he refuſed, but offered to fight a ſingle combat with him. Which <hi>Jabdas</hi> accepted; and it was agreed, that if he vanquiſht <hi>Althias,</hi> the <hi>Moors</hi> ſhould drink. Who were glad, and confident, ſeeing <hi>Althias</hi> a lean man, not tall; whereas <hi>Jabdas</hi> was the goodlieſt and valianteſt of all the <hi>Moors.</hi> They were on horſeback; and <hi>Jabdas</hi> threw firſt his Javelin, which <hi>Althias</hi> caught fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at him in his right hand (which amazed his enemy) and with his left hand
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50471:66"/>bent his bow (being both-handed) and killed <hi>Jabdas</hi> horſe. The <hi>Moors</hi> brought their Prince another horſe, upon which he leaped up, and ran away; the <hi>Moors</hi> following in diſorder. <hi>Althias</hi> recovered the captives and booty, and got a great name in <hi>Africk</hi> for this act.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Solomon,</hi> after a ſhort ſtay in <hi>Carthage,</hi> led the Army againſt <hi>Jabdas</hi> to mount <hi>Auraſium,</hi> for ſacking the Towns of <hi>Numidia,</hi> while the <hi>Roman</hi> Army was buſie in <hi>Byzacium.</hi> The other <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Princes alſo incenſed <hi>Solomon</hi> againſt him; as <hi>Maſſonas,</hi> being enemy to <hi>Jabdas,</hi> who killed <hi>Mephanias</hi> his father trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly, though he had married his daughter: And <hi>Orthaeus,</hi> becauſe he had plotted with <hi>Maſtinas,</hi> Prince of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> in <hi>Mauritania,</hi> to expell him, and the <hi>Moors</hi> his ſubjects, from their antient habitation. So the Army under <hi>Solomon,</hi> and their <hi>Mooriſh</hi> aides, encamped by the river of <hi>Amigas,</hi> which runs by <hi>Auraſium. Jabdas</hi> thought the champian diſadvantageous for him to fight in; ſo he made <hi>Auraſium</hi> as difficult as he could in the fit places for an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault.</p>
               <p>This mountain is 13 days journey from <hi>Carthage,</hi> and the greateſt we know; the circuit being three days journey. It is difficult to get up, but being up, and on even ground, are fields, fountains, rivers, and many admirable gardens; the wheat there, and all that grows, is twice as big as in any other part of <hi>Africk.</hi> Some neglected Caſtles alſo there are, the Inhabitants finding no uſe of them: who never were put into any fear ſince the <hi>Moors</hi> took <hi>Auraſium</hi> from the <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals.</hi> Nay they demoliſhed <hi>Tamugadis,</hi> a populous City to the Eaſtward of the mountain, upon the very entrance of the plain, that enemies might not lodg there, and for the Cities ſake approach the mountain. The Country to the weſt of <hi>Auraſium</hi> being large and good, the <hi>Moors</hi> had likewiſe; beyond whom are other <hi>Moors</hi> ſubject to <hi>Ortaeus,</hi> who aided <hi>Solomon.</hi> I have heard that man ſay, that beyond his Country is a Wilderneſs, and beyond that, men not black, like <hi>Moors,</hi> but with white bodies, and yellow hair.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solomon</hi> diſtributed monies amongſt his Auxiliaries, encouraged them, and with his whole Army aſcended mount <hi>Auraſium,</hi> in order of battel, thinking that day to try his fortune againſt the enemy; ſo that the ſouldier had brought but little fodder for their horſes. They went ſix miles and a quarter in very bad way, and lay all that night in the fields. And the ſeaventh day (going every day as much) they came to an old Caſtle by a river, called by the <hi>Latines, Mons-ſcuti.</hi> Here they had been told the enemy was encamped; but none encountring, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves encamped there, preparing to fight: they ſpent there three days. But ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the enemy abſolutely gone, and neceſſaries failing, <hi>Solomon</hi> and the whole Army doubted ſome plot of their Auxiliary <hi>Moors.</hi> Who knowing perfectly the ways of <hi>Auraſium,</hi> and in likelyhood the enemies deſignes, by riding to them ſecretly, and often being ſent by the <hi>Romans</hi> to diſcover, yet they never ſpake a true word. So they thought it beſt to be gone before ſome blow, and to return with greater proviſions, and better furniſhed in other things. Now they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, and ſuſpected treaſon from their Auxiliaries, whom they knew naturally falſe, and eſpecially when they aid the <hi>Romans,</hi> or any againſt the <hi>Moors.</hi> Upon all theſe conſiderations, and the famine pinching, they went down immediately, and made an entrenchment in the champian.</p>
               <p>But the winter being come, <hi>Solomon</hi> marcht to <hi>Carthage,</hi> where he prepared for another journey in the beginning of the ſpring to <hi>Auraſium,</hi> without any auxiliary <hi>Moors,</hi> if it might be; and he appointed forces and a fleet againſt the <hi>Moors</hi> in <hi>Sardinia;</hi> being a rich Iſland, and as big as two third parts of <hi>Sicily;</hi> the circumference of it is twenty days journey; and is in the mid-way between <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Carthage,</hi> and much vexed with <hi>Moors,</hi> who were confined and planted there with their wives and children, by the <hi>Vandals.</hi> There poſſeſt the mountains near <hi>Carnalis,</hi> and at firſt committed petty ſtealths upon the natives; but being grown to a number of 3000 men, they made open inroads, and ranſackt all the places near them, being by the natives called <hi>Barbaracini.</hi> Againſt theſe <hi>Moors Solomon</hi> prepared a fleet th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>BUt at the ſame time, <hi>Beliſarius</hi> being ſent into <hi>Italy</hi> by the Emperour, againſt <hi>Theodatus</hi> and the <hi>Goths,</hi> landed firſt in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and took the <hi>Iſland;</hi> the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner whereof I refer to my enſuing Hiſtory of the affairs of <hi>Italy.</hi> When I have written the occurrences of <hi>Africk,</hi> I will come to the Relation of <hi>Italy</hi> and the <hi>Goths.</hi> This winter <hi>Beliſarius</hi> ſpent in <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> in <hi>Carthage.</hi> And all this year the Sun had a fearfull and prodigious light, without beams, like that of the Moon, and for the moſt part it was as eclipſed, without the clear and uſual luſtre. And during the ſame, famine, war, and all kind of mortality did infeſt mankind. It was in the tenth year of <hi>Juſtinians</hi> reign.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of the ſpring, the Chriſtians celebrating their <hi>Eaſter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An. Dom. <hi>536.</hi> Juſt. <hi>10.</hi>
                  </note> the ſoldiers mutinyed in <hi>Africk</hi> upon this occaſion. The <hi>Roman</hi> ſoldiers having vanquiſht the <hi>Vandals,</hi> married their wives and daughters. Who drew their husbands to challenge the poſſeſſions formerly theirs, as being unjuſt (having enjoyed the ſame by the <hi>Vandals</hi>) to be deprived of them now, being married to their Conquerors. The ſoldiers having this put into their heads, thought they ought not to yield thoſe poſſeſſions to <hi>Solomon,</hi> who intended to annex the ſame to the Treaſury, and the Emperours houſe; not refuſing the ſlaves and moveables for ſpoils to the ſoldier; but the Lands he alleadged to belong to the Emperour, and State, which fed them, and gave them the quality of ſoldiers, not to conquer for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Lands taken by <hi>Barbarians</hi> from the Empire; but to recover them to the Treaſury, from whence they and the other Armies had their entertainments. Another party alſo there was which troubled <hi>Africk</hi> as much, or more. In the Army were ſome thouſand <hi>Arrian</hi> ſoldiers, moſt <hi>Herulians.</hi> Theſe were provoked by the <hi>Vandal</hi> Prieſts, being not allowed their accuſtomed divine ſervice, but bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from all, both Sacraments and Churches: For <hi>Juſtinian</hi> permitted not any Chriſtian not Orthodoxal, to have the benefit of Baptiſm, or any other Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Eſpecially they were troubled, the Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter</hi> approaching, wherein they might not baptize their children in the holy Laver, nor do what belong'd to the Feaſt. And Fortune heaped to this, another miſchief upon the <hi>Romans,</hi> by adding a ſupply to theſe Mutiners. The Emperour had made five horſe troops of the <hi>Vandals,</hi> brought to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> by <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> to lye perpetually in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Eaſt, under the title of <hi>Vandalici.</hi> The moſt of theſe went by ſea into the Eaſt, and made up the appointed troops, till this day ſerving againſt the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians.</hi> But 400 of them from <hi>Lesbos,</hi> forcing the Mariners, came upon the coaſt of <hi>Peloponeſus,</hi> and from thence ſailed into <hi>Africk,</hi> landing in a deſert coaſt; where leaving the ſhips, they went into <hi>Mauritania</hi> to mount <hi>Auraſium.</hi> This encouraged and more combined the mutinying ſoldiers, who had many conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and oaths about it.</p>
               <p>The Feaſt being at hand, the diſcontented <hi>Arrians,</hi> who were interdicted the Church, eagerly urged it. And the ring-leaders of them had reſolved to kill <hi>Solomon,</hi> the firſt day of the Feaſt, called the great day. The plot was undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerned by any: For though many were engaged in it, yet none miſliked, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed it; many of <hi>Solomons</hi> Lanciers, and Targetiers, and moſt of his houſhold-ſervants coveting thoſe poſſeſſions, were in the mutiny. At the day, <hi>Solomon</hi> ſate in the Church, apprehending no miſchief; The men appointed to kill him, made ſignes to one another, and had their hands on their ſwords; but did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: either reverencing the Church-ſervice, or abaſhed at the ſtate of their General, or by ſomething divine reſtrained: But divine ſervice being ended, and every man come home, the ſoldiers blamed each other for fainting, and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the plot the next day: When they likewiſe came from Church without doing any thing; and meeting in the market-place, railed upon one another, each man terming his fellow falſe, and faint-hearted, and reproaching his awe of <hi>Solomon.</hi> And their plot being divulged, they thought it unſafe to ſtay in <hi>Carthage.</hi> So the moſt of them went out, and pillaged the Villages, and uſed the <hi>Africans</hi> as
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50471:67"/>enemies. The reſt remained in the City unſuſpected, and ſeeming ignorant of the conſpiracy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solomon</hi> hearing what the ſoldiers did in the Country, and exhorting them in the City to good affection to the Emperour, at firſt they ſeemed to entertain his diſcourſe. But hearing how thoſe abroad did what they liſted in the Countrys, ſecurely; the fift day of their mutiny, they impudently railed upon <hi>Solomon,</hi> and the other Commanders in the <hi>Circus. Solomon</hi> ſeat <hi>Theodorus</hi> the <hi>Cappado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> to appeaſe them, a man that loved him not, and was ſuſpected to practiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. Whereupon the mutiners with cries choſe him their General, and with him went to the Palace, where they killed another <hi>Theodorus</hi> the Scout-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, a worthy man, and a good ſoldier. Being blouded, they killed all they met, whether <hi>Africans</hi> or <hi>Romans,</hi> if <hi>Solomons</hi> friends, or with mony about them. Then they pillaged the houſes, where no ſoldiers defended, taking away all of any value, till the night, and drink after their toil quieted them. <hi>Solomon</hi> fled to the great Church of the <hi>Palace;</hi> whither about the evening came <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus;</hi> and when the mutiners were aſleep, they went to the Lodging of <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> the <hi>Cappadocian,</hi> who conſtrained them to ſup, though they bad little mind to it, and brought them to a ſhip in the harbour, provided for them by <hi>Valerianus. Procopius,</hi> the writer of this Hiſtory, was in company, and five of <hi>Solomons</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue. After 37 miles ſailing, they came to <hi>Meſſua,</hi> a road for <hi>Carthage</hi> ſhipping, and a ſafe place. From hence <hi>Solomon</hi> ſent <hi>Martinus</hi> to <hi>Valerianus,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ommanders in <hi>Numidia,</hi> to attempt to reduce ſuch mutiners as any of them knew, by mony, and all means. And he wrote to <hi>Theodorus</hi> to take care of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> and to do what he could. Himſelf with <hi>Procopius</hi> went to <hi>Beliſarius</hi> to <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> relating the accident, and praying him to repair to <hi>Carthage,</hi> and vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Emperour from this affront of his own ſoldiers.</p>

                  </gap>nt not with <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> being either concealed, or neglected by the Officers. In all they were 1000 men, who went readily to <hi>Stot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zas</hi> Camp, and a multitude of ſlaves came alſo, <hi>Stotzas</hi> being near, ſent to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi> to yield without further hurt. But <hi>Theodorus</hi> and the reſt profeſſed to guard the City for the Emperour, and required them to forbear force; ſending to them <hi>Joſephius,</hi> who had been of the Emperours guard, and now was one of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſarius</hi> retinue, and lately ſent to <hi>Carthage</hi> about buſineſs: whom <hi>Stotzas</hi> put to death for his meſſage, and fell to the ſiege. And the Citizens afraid, were think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to yield upon compoſition. When <hi>Beliſarius</hi> with 100 of his Lanciers and Targetiers, and <hi>Solomon</hi> with one ſhip arrived at <hi>Carthage</hi> toward the evening: the beſiegers expecting the rendring the City on the next day, and with that hope lying ſtill that night; and when it was day, hearing of <hi>Beliſarius</hi> arrival, ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully roſe, and ran away. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> got together 2000 of the Army, and with fair words and mony, exhorting thm to a good affection to the Emperour, he purſued the flyers, and overtook them at <hi>Membreſa,</hi> about 43 miles from <hi>Carthage.</hi> Here they both encamped, and prepared to fight; <hi>Beliſarius</hi> by the river of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gradas;</hi> the other upon a high ragged ground: Neither would enter the City, being unwalled. The next day they drew out to fight, the mutiners truſting in their numbers, whom <hi>Beliſarius</hi> his men deſpiſed, for fooliſh fellows, undiſciplined.</p>
               <p>And to imprint this the more firmly, <hi>Beliſarius</hi> ſpake thus unto them. <q>Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſoldiers! This happens to the Emperour againſt our hopes and wiſhes, to come to a battel with our kinſmen and companions, whom we cannot conquer
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50471:67"/>without grief. But our comfort is, that we began not; we only defend our ſelves. He who by his treaſons renounces his kindred, is not killed by his friends, but in the quality of an enemy is puniſhed for his injury done them. Theſe men have proclaimed themſelves enemies, <hi>Barbarians,</hi> any thing, by their ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>Africk,</hi> and killing both natives, and many <hi>Roman</hi> ſoldiers, for no offence, but their good affection to the State. For this we come to chaſtiſe them, now enemies, though ſome time friends. No men are friends or enemies by nature; but in their actions are either united in a joint aſſiſtance by a ſimilitude of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and opinions, or diſunited by a diſſimilitude. And as they are unjuſt men and enemies, we are to fight with them: So are they to be deſpiſed, being a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude not aſſembled by Law, but upon wrong: And ſuch never fight valiantly: valour not vouchſafing to keep company with outlaws, and men unjuſt: neither will they keep their orders, nor obey the directions of their new General, who wanting power to be confident, muſt neceſſarily be contemned by them For rebellion is naturally hated, never honoured; and being timerous it ſelf, cannot govern the ſubject, and keep him in awe. So that the enemy wanting both va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and government, their defeat will be eaſie; and you muſt march againſt them with contempt, not eſtimating the power of a battel by numbers, but by order and valour.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stotzas</hi> alſo uſed this exhortation. <q>You have with me, ſhaken off the <hi>Roman</hi> ſervitude; and grudg not now to die for the liberty gotten by your valour. It is not ſo grievous to grow old and die in ſlavery, as after freedom to return to it again; the interim of eaſe making the calamity taſte more ſowre. You may conſider therefore, how in the overthrow of the <hi>Vandals,</hi> you had your part in the toil, and others now poſſeſs the ſpoils; and how being ſoldiers, you are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to a life of hazarding, either for the Emperour, if you ſerve him again, or for your ſelves, if you keep your liberty. And the better of theſe two you may now chuſe, by reſolving in this action to fight, without fainting. Conſider alſo that you have taken arms, and if you now be ſubdued, you will not find the <hi>Romans</hi> gentle maſters, but ſhall ſuffer extremities, with the addition of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtly ruined: So you ſee our death will be honorable if we die, and if we be victorious, our life will be free and happie; but bitter, if we be beaten, when our only hope muſt be in our enemies mercy. And in the battel the enemy hath much the diſadvantage in numbers, and hath no great mind to charge us, wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it ſeems, their part in our liberty.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus ſpake <hi>Stotzas,</hi> and the Armies came to the encounter. But a ſtrong wind blew in the mutiners faces, who fearing the diſadvantage of fighing, where the wind would carry the enemies arrows violently on them, and abate the force of theirs; they wheeled about, thinking the enemy, not to have their backs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, would turn about too; and ſo have the wind in their faces. But <hi>Beliſarius</hi> ſeeing them open their ranks, and ſtraggle diſorderly, bad begin the fight, which <hi>Stotzas</hi> men not looking for, fell into confuſion, and ran away into <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midia,</hi> where they rallied again. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> followed no execution, thinking it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough with ſo ſmall an Army to beat the enemy, and ſend him going.</p>
               <p>To the ſoldiers lie gave the enemies camp to pillage, who found not a man in it, but much wealth, and many <hi>Vandal</hi> women, for whoſe ſake this war was.

               <p>The Commanders in <hi>Numidia,</hi> hearing of <hi>Stotzas</hi> being there, and gathering head, prepared to fight with him. <hi>Marcellus</hi> and <hi>Cyrillus</hi> commanded the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, <hi>Barbatus</hi> the horſe, and <hi>Terentius</hi> and <hi>Sarapis</hi> the foot; <hi>Marcellus</hi> commanded in chief, being Governor of <hi>Numidia.</hi> Who hearing of <hi>Stotzas</hi> being, with a few at <hi>Gazophyli,</hi> a Towne two dayes journey from <hi>Conſtantina;</hi> marcht with ſpeed to prevent the coming of the other mutiners. The Armies being near, and the fight ready to begin, <hi>Stotzas</hi> came alone into the midſt, and ſpake thus to the enemy. <q>Fellow ſoldiers! It is unjuſt in you to take arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50471:68"/>your kinſmen and companions, who have undertaken this war with the Emperour, being grieved to ſee your miſeries and wrongs. Do you not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how long your pay hath been due, and ſtill is detained from you? how the ſpoyls of the enemy, your prizes appointed by the law of arms, are taken from you? The fruits of your victory others muſt riot upon, while you follow as their ſervants If I offend you, uſe your anger againſt this body preſently; for I hate to fly to others for refuge. If you have no exception to me, come and uſe your arms for your ſelves.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The ſoldiers embraced this motion of <hi>Stotzas,</hi> and affectionately ſaluted him; and their Commanders ſeeing it, retired into a Church in <hi>Gazophyli. Stotzas</hi> joyned the Armies againſt them, gave them his faith for their coming out, and then killed them all.</p>

                  </note> and <hi>Domnicus,</hi> to be Commanders of the foot, upon the deceaſe of <hi>John</hi> his predeceſſor. <hi>Germanus</hi> being landed at <hi>Carthage,</hi> muſtered the forces, and by the Check Roll of the ſoldiers names, he found a third part of them to be in <hi>Carthage</hi> and other Cities, and the reſt joyned with the Rebels. Wherefore he would begin no fight, but took care of the Army; and finding the ſoldiers in <hi>Carthage</hi> to be kinſmen and comrades of the enemies; he courted them: and ſaid the Emperour had ſent him expreſly into <hi>Africk</hi> to vindicate the ſoldiers, and to chaſtiſe ſuch as had wrong'd them. Which the mutiners hearing, came in by few at a time; whom <hi>Germanus</hi> received courteouſly, gave them his faith, and held them in good account, paying them their full dues for the time they had been in rebellion. The report whereof drew them in troops from the enemy. And then <hi>Germanus</hi> hoping to match the Rebels in numbers, prepared for a battel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stotzas</hi> alſo perceiving the miſchief, and fearing more defection of his men, made haſte to try his fortune. He had ſome hope too, if he could get near the ſoldiers in <hi>Carthage,</hi> to get them to run away to him. And with this hope he chiefly confirmed his Army, and ſpeedily marcht to <hi>Carthage,</hi> and encamped near the ſea, about four miles from the City.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Germanus</hi> armed and put in order his ſoldiers, and having heard what hopes <hi>Stotzas</hi> had, he ſpake thus. <q>Fellow ſoldiers! you have no juſt complaint againſt the Emperours uſage of you: Who in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> took you to him newly come out of the Country with a knap-ſack, and one poor coat; and hath now made you ſo great, that the <hi>Roman</hi> State is committed to you. But how he hath been ſcorned by you, and ſuffered the greateſt extremities, you cannot be ignorant. Whereof the remembrance indeed he would have you retain, but the proſecution he clearly remits, expecting this only ſatisfaction from you, to be aſhamed of what you have done, and thereupon to learn a new leſſon of fidelity, and to repair your former ingratitude. The timely repentance of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring men obtains their pardon; and a ſeaſonable ſervice done, may take the name of ungratefull men from you. Nay if at this time you appear well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to the Emperour, know this, that no memory will remain of what is paſt, The actions of men have their names from the concluſion: and errors done, no ages can undoe; but being repaired by better deeds, they get a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſilence, and commonly are forgotten. If now you neglect your duties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe rogues; your many battels hereafter for the <hi>Romans,</hi> and victories of our enemies, will not by the Emperour be thought a recompence. The braveſt apology is, to get honour in the very things men have erred in. Thus you are to think concerning the Emperour. And I, who never wrong'd you, but to my power have ſhewed my affection to you, entreat this only of you in this danger,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50471:68"/>That no man will march againſt the enemy contrary to his mind; but if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to joyn with their Army, to paſs over to them immediately; doing us this only favour, not to abuſe us ſecretly, but in an open way: Which is the reaſon I move this here between the Armies, and not in <hi>Carthage;</hi> not to hinder any that will run away; but to leave it in every mans power, to ſhew his affection to the State.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Every man upon this ſpeech, buſtled to ſhew himſelf to his General, and to ſwear the good affection he had to the Emperour. And ſome days they were thus encamped againſt each other. At length the mutiners ſeeing none come to them, whom <hi>Stotzas</hi> told them of, being afraid, as failing in their hope, they disbanded, and went into <hi>Numidia,</hi> where were their wives and booty. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus</hi> ſhortly after, with his Army well prepared, and with ſtore of waggons for it, came thither alſo; and overtaking the enemy at a Town called <hi>Scalae Vete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> he prepared to fight, ſetting the waggons in front, and the foot by them (commanded by <hi>Domnicus</hi>) to ſecureing their backs. The beſt horſemen, and ſuch as came from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> himſelf had at the left hand of the foot. The reſt he ſet at the right wing in three Troops, commanded by <hi>Ildiger,</hi> and <hi>Theodorus</hi> the <hi>Cappadocian;</hi> and the biggeſt by <hi>John</hi> the brother of <hi>Pappus:</hi> the fourth by himſelf. The Mutiners ſtood oppoſite to them, not in much order, but ſcatter'd like <hi>Barbarians.</hi> Not far behind came many thouſand <hi>Moors,</hi> led by <hi>Jabdas</hi> and <hi>Orthaeas,</hi> not all true to <hi>Stotzas;</hi> many having ſent to <hi>Germanus,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in the fight to turn againſt the enemy. <hi>Germanus</hi> could not much truſt them, being a people ſo falſe to all men. And they joyned not with the muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but kept aloof behind, waiting the event, and with the conquerours to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the vanquiſhed. <hi>Stotzas</hi> approaching the enemy, and ſeeing the Generals Enſigne, call'd to his men, and marcht towards him. But the <hi>Herulian</hi> mutiners ſtopt him, ſaying, that the powers of <hi>Germanus</hi> they knew not; but they knew that the enemy in the right wing would not ſtand. So that charging them, and they running away, they are likely to put the enemies whole Army in diſorder; whereas if <hi>Germanus</hi> beat them, all will be loſt. <hi>Stotzas</hi> approving the advice, left the reſt to fight with <hi>Germanus,</hi> and himſelf with his beſt men, gave on upon <hi>John,</hi> and his troops, who not abiding them, ran away in confuſion. The muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners took their Enſignes, and purſued them. Some turn'd upon the foot, who began to disband; When <hi>Germanus</hi> drawing his ſword, and calling upon his troop to do the like, with much adoe he routed the enemy on his ſide; and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopt up to <hi>Stotzas,</hi> with the troops of <hi>Ildiger</hi> and <hi>Theodorus.</hi> And all was ſo mingled, that the mutiners chaſing ſome of their enemies, fell among others, and were ſlain. The confuſion grew great, and <hi>Germanus</hi> his troops coming on neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er behind them, they were afraid, and thought no more of fighting. Both ſides uſing the ſame language, and arms, and differing not in ſhape, habit, nor any thing, could not be diſtinguiſhed; till <hi>Germanus</hi> directed the Emperours Army to ask any they took, what he was; if he ſaid he was a ſoldier of <hi>Germanus,</hi> to bid him give the watch-word, which if he could not, to kill him. <hi>Germanus</hi> had his horſe killed in the fight, and himſelf being down and in danger, his life-guard reſcued and remounted him. <hi>Stotzas</hi> in the tumult with ſome few eſcaped; and <hi>Germanus</hi> marcht againſt the enemies camp; where the mutiners who had the guard of the Trenches, oppoſed him; and there was a ſtiff fight, the mutiners being very near beating them back. But ſome ſent by <hi>Germanus</hi> to attempt the camp in another place, got into the entrenchment with eaſe, which the mutiners ſeeing, ran away; and <hi>Germanus</hi> with the Army, entred the camp. The ſoldiers fell to pillage, neither thinking of the enemy, nor hearkning to their Generals directions; Who fearing the enemy might rally, and charge them, ſtood in the camp gate, crying and complaining for diſcipline to men that heard him not. The <hi>Moors</hi> followed the execution upon the mutiners, and pillaged the camp with the Army. <hi>Stotzas</hi> at firſt truſting to the <hi>Moors,</hi> rode up to them, to renew the fight. But finding what they were doing, he made a ſhift to eſcape with 100 men. Many made head with him, and tryed to fight again, but being repulſed, they all ſubmitted to <hi>Germanus;</hi> only <hi>Stotzas,</hi> with a few <hi>Vandals,</hi> retired into <hi>Mauritania,</hi> and there marrying a daughter of one of their Princes, remained. And ſo ended this mutiny.</p>

Thoſe mutiners with threatnings and tumult, ran to the <hi>Circus;</hi> and ſuch other conſpirators as knew their intent, ran thither by one and one.

               <p>
                  <hi>Solomon,</hi> hearing this, prepared to fight; and the next day, meeting ſome enemies driving a great prey, he defeated them, and took it from them. The ſouldiers murmured becauſe he kept it to himſelf, not giving them the ſpoiles of War: But he bad them ſtay till the War was ended, and then every man ſhould have his ſhare according to his deſert. The <hi>Barbarians</hi> again urged to give battel. But of the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſome were abſent, others went on with no heart: yet at firſt the fight was equall; afterward, the <hi>Moors</hi> ſurmounting much in numbers, the <hi>Romans</hi> ran away. <hi>Solomon</hi> with his company endured their ſhot a while, then being over preſt, fled; and at a torrent his horſe ſtumbling he fell. His Lifeguard ſet him up again, but being in pain not able to hold his bridle, the <hi>Barbarians</hi> overtook and killed him, and many of his guard, <hi>Solomon</hi> being dead thus the Emperour gave the Government of <hi>Africk</hi> to <hi>Sergius,</hi> who proved the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Province. All were diſcontented; the commander at his youth, indiſcretion, and inſolence, and the impertinent affronts he did them, wherein he imployed his power, wealth, and the authority of his place; The ſouldiers, becauſe he was a coward; And the provincials, for all this, and moreover for his unſatiable love of their wives and Eſtates.</p>
               <p>Above all, <hi>John,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Siſinniolus,</hi> being an able ſouldier, and of great reputation, was offended with his greatneſs, and extream ingratitude to himſelf. So that neither he nor a man among them would draw their ſwords againſt the enemy. Almoſt all the <hi>Moors</hi> followed <hi>Antalas,</hi> who had ſent for <hi>Stotzas</hi> out of <hi>Mauritania.</hi> And <hi>Antalas</hi> then wrote this letter to the Emperour. <q>That I am the ſervant of your Empire I deny not; But the <hi>Moors</hi> have been forced to take arms upon the baſe injuries done by <hi>Solomon,</hi> not to riſe up in arms againſt you, but to reſiſt an enemy; eſpecially I from whom he was not contented onely to take away my allowances, deſigned by <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> and by you given me, but he hath killed my brother guiltleſſe; we have now righted our ſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him that wrong'd us; and if you will have the <hi>Moors</hi> obſequious ſervants of your Empire, as formerly, command <hi>Sergius</hi> the Nephew of <hi>Solomon</hi> to leave <hi>Africk,</hi> and ſend ſome other Generall: you cannot want men far worthier then <hi>Sergius.</hi> So long as he commands your Army, there can be no peace between the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Moors.</hi>
                  </q> The Emperour notwithſtanding this letter, and though he knew the Generall hatred of <hi>Sergius;</hi> yet in reſpect of <hi>Solomons</hi> worth, and manner of death, he would not remove him.</p>

                  <hi>Athanaſius;</hi> who ſoothed him, and ſeemed to like the action wonderous well: Then he ſent the Biſhop of the City, to will <hi>Areobindus</hi> to come to the Palace upon aſſurances of ſafety; threatning, if he refuſed, to pull him out, and kill him. The Biſhop, named <hi>Reparatus,</hi> went, and by <hi>Gontharis</hi> his direction of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to ſwear that he ſhould have no hurt, and told him what he threatned upon his refuſall. <hi>Areobindus</hi> was afraid, and promiſed, if the Biſhop at the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the holy Baptiſme would in <hi>Gontharis</hi> his name by oath aſſure his ſecurity, that he would go with him. This the Biſhop did, and <hi>Areobindus</hi> without more ſcruple went with him, having on a garment called in Latine <hi>Caſula</hi>) not ſit for a Generall, nor a common ſoldier, but for a ſlave rather. At the Palace he took the Bible from the Biſhop; and being brought to <hi>Gontharis,</hi> he fell upon his face, and lay ſo a long time, holding out his ſupplication, and the Bible, and his little ſon, newly made partaker of the holy Baptiſme, at which the Biſhop had ſworn his ſafety. <hi>Gontharis</hi> raiſed him with much adoe; he conjuring him by all that is holy, to tell him if his life were ſafe. <hi>Gontharis</hi> bad him be of courage; for the next day he ſhould go from <hi>Carthage</hi> ſafe, with his wife and goods. Then he diſmiſſed the Biſhop, and invited <hi>Areobindus</hi> and <hi>Athanaſius</hi> to ſup with him in the Palace. At ſupper he honoured <hi>Areobindus,</hi> placing him on his right hand upon the couch. After ſupper he would not let him go, forcing him to lie in a Chamber alone whither he ſent <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>litheus</hi> and ſome others, who after his much crying and wailing, and words to move pitty, killed him. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> they ſpared, deſpiſing his age. The next day <hi>Gontharis</hi> ſent <hi>Areobindus</hi> his head to <hi>Antalas,</hi> but kept his goods. and the 1500 ſoldiers. At which <hi>Antalas</hi> chaſed; and it troubled him to ſee how <hi>Gontharis</hi> had forſwore himſelf to <hi>Areobindus</hi> his friend, ſo that he could not think he ſhould ever keep faith to himſelf, or any. After much debate, he reſolved to ſubmit to the Emperour, and ſo marcht away. He then ſent to <hi>Marcentius,</hi> Commander of the Horſe in <hi>Byzacium</hi> (who was fled into an Iſland) acquainted him with the buſineſs, and upon aſſurances got him to come to him. So <hi>Marcentius</hi> was with <hi>Antalas;</hi> and the ſoldiers of <hi>Byzacium,</hi> true to the Emperour, guarded <hi>Adramettus.</hi> The mutiners of <hi>Stotzas</hi> about 1000 men, were led by <hi>John</hi> to <hi>Gontharis,</hi> who gladly received them. Of them were 500 <hi>Romans,</hi> and 80. <hi>Hunnes;</hi> the reſt were <hi>Vandals.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Artabanes,</hi> upon aſſurances came to the Palace with his <hi>Armenians,</hi> profeſſing his ſervice to the uſurper. But cloſely he plotted his death, conſulting with <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorius,</hi> his Nephew, and <hi>Artaſiris,</hi> one of his guard. <hi>Gregorius,</hi> to egge him on, told him, <q>That he had now the means to gain the glory of <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> nay to exceed it. He, with a gallant Army, a huge treaſure, with many Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders and Counſellors; with a Fleet of ſhips (the like whereof this age had not heard of) with ſtore of horſe and arms, and with a preparation fitting the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, had recovered <hi>Africk,</hi> All which was now ſo caſt away, as if none of it had ever been; and that the <hi>Romans</hi> from <hi>Beliſarius</hi> his victory were fallen to be abuſed in their perſons, and robbed of their goods. But that it was onely in his ſpirit, wit, and ſword now, to recover all this to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour. He bad him conſider, how he was of the race of the <hi>Arſacides,</hi> and think how men nobly born muſt be every where valiant. Being a youth, he ſlew <hi>Acacius,</hi> Governour of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and <hi>Sittas</hi> the Generall; and thereby was made known to King <hi>Choſroes,</hi> and made war for him againſt the <hi>Romans:</hi> that being ſuch a perſon, he ought not now to abandon the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire thus to a drunken dog, but to make it appear, that his former actions proceeded from true nobleneſs and valour: that himſelf, and <hi>Artaſiris</hi> would ſerve his commands therein.</q> Thus <hi>Gregorius</hi> incenſed <hi>Artabanes</hi> againſt the Tyrant.</p>

Returning therefore to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> he told the Tyrant the neceſſity of a greater Army; who after conſulting with <hi>Paſiphilus,</hi> armed the whole forces, and purpoſed to lead them himſelf, leaving a garriſon in <hi>Carthage.</hi> And every day he killed ſome upon cauſeleſſe jealouſies.

His feaſt was in a room where three couches ſtood ever ready: upon the uppermoſt himſelf ſate, with <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and <hi>Artabanes,</hi> and ſome of <hi>Gontharis</hi> favourites, and <hi>Peter</hi> a <hi>Thracian,</hi> formerly of the guard to <hi>Solomon.</hi> At both the other couches were the beſt men of the <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals: John,</hi> the captain of <hi>Stotzas</hi> mutiners, was feaſted by <hi>Paſiphilus,</hi> and the reſt ſeverally by <hi>Gontharis</hi> friends: <hi>Artabanes</hi> when he was invited, reſolved it for a ſit opportunity to kill the Tyrant, and to execute his deſigne. He acquainted <hi>Gregorius</hi> and <hi>Artaſiris</hi> therewith, and three other of his guard; theſe he directed to get in with their ſwords (the faſhion being, while the Commanders feaſt, for their guard to ſtand behind them) and when they ſee their time, to fall to work ſuddainly, and <hi>Artaſiris</hi> to begin. <hi>Gregorius</hi> he inſtructed to bring many of their valianteſt <hi>Armenians</hi> to the Palace onely with ſwords (it not being lawfull to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their Commanders in a City with other weapons,) and leaving them in the utter Court, to go in with the guard. And they to pretend themſelves jealous, leſt <hi>Gontharis</hi> had invited <hi>Artabanes</hi> for no good, and to deſire to ſtand among <hi>Gontharis</hi> guards to guard their Captain. And then in ſport, to eatch the others ſhields, and to toſſe them, and play with them, and when they heard the cry within, to put on the ſhields and run in. This direction of <hi>Artabanes Gregorius</hi> put in execution, and <hi>Artaſiris</hi> had this deviſe alſo. He cut arrowes in two, and the pieces he thruſt in round about his left arm to his elbow: tying them with whip-cord, and covering all with the ſleeve of his coat; that he might take any blow made at him upon his arme, and ſo cauſe it to glaunce down the wood of the arrowes from off the body. To <hi>Artabanes</hi> alſo he ſpake thus <q>I will undertake this without the leaſt fear, and I hope with this ſword to pierce <hi>Gontharis.</hi> The ſucceſſe I know not, whither God offended with the Tyrant will aſſiſt me, or, to puniſh my ſins, croſſe me. If you ſee him not mortally wounded, kill me with this ſword inſtantly; leſt by torture I ſhould diſcover you, and ſo baſely periſh my ſelf, and be forced to ruine you too.</q> Having thus ſaid, he went with <hi>Gregorius</hi> and one of the guard, and ſtood behind <hi>Artabanes.</hi> The reſt ſtaid with the guards without, and did as they were directed. <hi>Artaſiris</hi> at the beginning of the feaſt would have done it, and had his hand upon his cimiter. But <hi>Gregorius</hi> ſtopt him, ſaying in the <hi>Armenian</hi> tongue; that <hi>Gontharis</hi> was yet himſelf, not having drunk much wine. 'O the brave ſpirit in me you ſuppreſſe now!

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>litheus,</hi> and two other of the guard by <hi>Gontharis.

               <p>
                  <hi>Artaſiris</hi> being come near to <hi>Gontharis,</hi> one of the waiters thruſt him off, and perceiving his naked ſword, cryed out, what's this my friends? <hi>Gontharis</hi> croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his hand over his own right ſhoulder, turned about to look at him. In the doing whereof <hi>Artaſiris</hi> ſtruck him with his ſword, and cut off part of his head, and his fingers. <hi>Peter</hi> cryed out to <hi>Artaſiris</hi> to kill the wickedeſt of all men. <hi>Artabanes</hi> ſeeing the Tyrant down, and ſitting next him, with a broad knife he had hanging at his ſide, thruſt him into the left ſide up to the haft, and there left it: <hi>Gontharis</hi> ſtrove to riſe; but fell, the wound being mortal. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>litheus</hi> made a blow to have cleft <hi>Artaſiris</hi> head: but he held up his left arm, and had the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of his own wit at his moſt need: For the ſword loſing the vigour upon thoſe arrows about his arm, he had no hurt, but he killed <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>litheus Peter</hi> and <hi>Artaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> took up the ſwords of <hi>Gontharis</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>litheus,</hi> and killed the other two of the guard. The <hi>Armenians</hi> who ſtood without with the guards, hearing the crie and tumult, ſnatcht up the ſhields according to their plot, and ran to the other couches, where they ſlew the <hi>Vandals,</hi> and <hi>Gontharis</hi> favorites. <hi>Artabanes</hi> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>Athanaſius</hi> openly, to look to the treaſures of the Palace, all being there Which <hi>Areobindus</hi> left. The guards without hearing of the Tyrants death, joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed preſently with the <hi>Armenians,</hi> having been moſt of <hi>Areobindus</hi> retinue. And with one voice, they all cryed, Emperour <hi>Juſtinian</hi> victorious! which growing very loud from ſuch a multitude, reacht to moſt parts of the City. Such as were well affected to the Emperour, brake into the mutiners lodgings, and killed them, being aſleep or eating, or amazed with the terror of it; and among them, <hi>Paſiphilus.

                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:50471:76"/>then to runne a hazard by contending with the Emperour. <hi>Theodoricus</hi> liked his Counſell and went into <hi>Italy</hi> with all the <hi>Goths,</hi> putting their Wives and Children in Waggons, and all the Goods they could carry. They could not croſſe the <hi>Jonian</hi> Gulfe,<note place="margin">Theſe were ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> now, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Gulfe of <hi>Venice,</hi> neer unto <hi>Epida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> now <hi>Durazzo.</hi>
                  </note> wanting ſhips, but compaſſed the Gulfe, and paſſed by the <hi>Taulantians,</hi> and other Nations. <hi>Odoacer</hi> and his people oppoſed them, and were beaten in many Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells: then they ſhut themſelves up in <hi>Ravenna</hi> with their Prince, and in other ſtrong Towns. All the Townes the <hi>Goths</hi> took in by Siege, ſave the Caſtle of <hi>Caeſina,</hi> about thirty ſeven miles diſtant from <hi>Ravenna,</hi> and <hi>Ravenna</hi> it ſelfe, where <hi>Odoacer</hi> was; which they could not get by Force nor Compoſition. It is ſcituate in an open Champian, at the bottome of the <hi>Jonian</hi> gulfe, diſtant only a quarter of a mile from the Sea. <hi>Ravenna</hi> is hard of acceſſe for an Army by Sea or Land; no ſhips can land upon the ſhore, by reaſon of a ſhelve of almoſt foure miles lying before it, which keepes the Sayler far from the Coaſt, though it ſeem neer at firſt. Neither is it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachable by an Army of Foot, by reaſon of the River <hi>Poe,</hi> (by ſome called <hi>Eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danus</hi>) which deſcends from the mountaines of <hi>Gaule;</hi> and of other navigable Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and Lakes, compaſſing the City with waters, where happens a dayly wonder. The ſea each morning riſes a dayes journey into the Land, and makes it navigable; and at evening draws home her waters, and ſpoyles the paſſage. Such as are to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to the City Merchandize, or to export the ſame, towe their ſhips to the place where the water uſes to make a Paſſage, and there ſtay for a Floud; which coming, by little and little they float their Veſſells, and ſteere away.</p>
               <p>This happens all along that coaſt to <hi>Aquileia,</hi> but not alwayes alike: when the Light of the moon is little, the tyde is weak, and after the firſt halfe moon to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the courſe of the floud is ſtronger.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Theodorick</hi> and the <hi>Goths</hi> ſpent three yeares in the Siege of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> and were wearied with it, aſwell as <hi>Odoacer</hi> and his men, who were alſo preſt with wants: So that by the mediation of the Biſhop of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> they came to an accord, that <hi>Theodorick</hi> and <hi>Odoacer</hi> ſhould remaine in <hi>Ravenna</hi> upon equall tearmes. This for a while was obſerved; but <hi>Theodorick</hi> (as he ſayd) finding him plotting againſt him, invited him to a Feaſt, and killed him; and gaining ſo the <hi>Barbarian</hi> Enemyes ſurviving, he had the ſole Dominion of the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Italians.</hi> He did not aſſume the Habit, or Style of Emperour of the Romans, but continued the name of <hi>Rex,</hi> as the <hi>Barbarians</hi> call their Rulers. In the government of his Subjects he had all the Ornaments of a true King; being zealous of Juſtice, and maintaining the Lawes; guarding alſo the Province from the Neighbouring Barbarians, and attaining to a great heighth of wiſdome and valour. He never did Injury to his Subjects, nor ſuffered others, that practiſed ſuch things: Onely he diſtributed to the <hi>Goths</hi> the Lands by <hi>Odoacer</hi> allotted for his Partizans. So that he was in repute an Uſurper; but in Effect a true Prince, no leſſe then thoſe, who have ſucceſſively beene graced with that Dignity. The <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> loved him exceedingly, and not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ordinary Humour; for in States, men have ſeverall Inclinations, and while things are as they would have them, they are pleaſed with the preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; but if otherwiſe, they are male-content.</p>

                  <hi>THeodorick</hi> having raigned thirty ſeven yeares, died, being growen terrible to his Enemyes, and much beloved by his Subjects. The manner of his Death was thus. <hi>Symmachus,</hi> and his Son in Law, <hi>Boetius,</hi> ancient noble men, and chelfe of the Senate, having been Conſulls, and both being Philoſophers, juſt men, and great Relievers of the poore, had many bitter envyers; by whoſe falſe accuſations <hi>Theodorick</hi> being perſwaded, that they plotted againſt him, put them to Death, and confiſcated their Eſtates. Not long after, his Wayters ſet before him at Supper a great head of a Fiſh, which ſeemed to him to be the Head of <hi>Symmachus</hi> lately mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and with the teeth ſticking out, and fierce glaring eyes to threaten him. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing frighted at it, he became chill, and preſently went to bed, commanding ſtore of

This was the firſt, and laſt wrong he ever did his Subjects, in pronouncing ſentence thus againſt men without Examination. † <hi>Atalarick,</hi>

Not long after <hi>Juſtinian</hi> received the Empire in <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> and <hi>Amalaſuntha</hi> governed as her Sonnes Guardian, being Wiſe, Juſt, and of a very manly nature. She never, during her Government, layd corporall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, or fine upon any <hi>Romane,</hi> nor gave way to the <hi>Goths</hi> longing to do them Injuryes. She reſtored to the Children of <hi>Symmachus</hi> and <hi>Boetius</hi> their Eſtates; and ſhee deſired to forme her Son in his manner of living like to the <hi>Roman</hi> Princes. Shee cauſed him to frequent the Grammar Schoole, and choſe three diſcreet, moderate men of the Gothick Nation to accompany him. This the <hi>Goths</hi> miſliked, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to wrong the Subjects, would have him bred more according to the <hi>Barbarian</hi> way. The Mother once taking her Sonne in ſome diſ-order in the Bed-chamber, ſtrake him; and he weeping, went out into the great Chamber, where ſome <hi>Goths</hi> ſeeing him, made a great matter of it, and rayled upon <hi>Amalaſuntha,</hi> that ſhee made haſte to be rid of the youth, and marrying ſome man, with him to raigne over <q>the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Italians.</hi> And their principall men aſſembling, complained; that their King was ill bred, and not as was fit for him; that Learning is oppoſite to Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; that this ſchooling by old men produces commonly cowardly and low ſpirits, and that whoſoever will prove daring, and a man of Reputation, muſt be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from feare of Schoole Maſters, and imploy his Study in Armes. <hi>Theodorick</hi> (they ſayd) ſuffered not the <hi>Goths</hi> to ſend their Sonnes to the Grammer ſchoole; alleadging that if they were ſeaſoned once with the feare of a Feruler, they would never deſpiſe a Sword, nor a Lance. They beſought the Queene to conſider, how <hi>Theodorcik</hi> gained large Provinces, and a Kingdome to which he had no right, and was dead without knowing his Letters; and therefore to diſmiſſe thoſe Paedagogues, and to give <hi>Atalarick</hi> Companions of his own Age, who growing up with him, might incite him to governe according to the Barbarian Lawes.</q>
                  <hi>Amalaſuntha</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved not theſe reaſons, but fearing Treaſon, ſhee ſeemed pleaſed with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and yeilded to their demands. The old men left <hi>Atalarick,</hi> and Youths were bred up, with him, having ſome ſmall advantage of yeares above him: who when he was come to yeares, provoking him to Drinke, and Women, made him extreamly ill-conditioned, and ſo fooliſh, as to be diſobedient to his Mother; nay to deſert her, in a Faction of <hi>Barbarians,</hi> who impudently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded her to retyre from Court. But <hi>Amalaſuntha</hi> feared not their Faction, nor womanlike ſoftned her Reſolution, but with the Majeſty of a Prince ſhee pickt out three of moſt Account, and moſt faulty, and confined them ſingle, and far aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to the remoteſt parts of <hi>Italy.</hi> They were reported to be imployed in guarding the Marches againſt the Enemy; but they continued ſtill correſpondence with their Freinds and Kinſmen, and all men flockt to them, and the conſpiracy grow ripe: Which ſhee not able to ſtand againſt, ſhee ſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the <hi>Goths</hi> warring with the <hi>Gepaedes</hi> about <hi>Sirmium,</hi> had uſed hoſtitility upon <hi>Gratiana,</hi> a City in the marches of <hi>Illyrium:</hi> All which the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour charged <hi>Amalaſuntha</hi> with, and wrote his Letter to her by <hi>Alexander;</hi> who left the Biſhops at <hi>Rome</hi> to negotiate their affaires, and repayring to <hi>Ravenna,</hi> had acceſſe to <hi>Amalaſuntha,</hi> whom privately he acquainted with the Emperours <q>propoſitions; and openly preſented the Letter, which was thus. You detaine from us our Caſtle of <hi>Lilyboeum;</hi> you have entertayned our fugitive Souldiers, and do not yet ſend them back; you have alſo uſed our City of <hi>Gratiana</hi> with extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity without cauſe; from all which you are to judge what the concluſion is likely to be. <hi>Amalaſuntha</hi> to this Letter returned this anſwer. It were more fit for a great Emperour, and one who pretends to virtue, to aſſiſt an Orphan, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of theſe paſſages, then upon no ground to quarrell with him; no victory bringing credit, when the oppoſition is not equall. You expoſtulate for <hi>Lilyboeum,</hi> and ten fugitives, and an Errour of Souldiers marching againſt their Enemyes, unwittingly committed upon a City in Amity with us. Do not thus, O Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour! But thinke how in your invaſion of the <hi>Vandales</hi> wee gave you no impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nay gave you quiet paſſage, and free market freindly of what you needed, cheifely of Horſes in ſuch abundance, as with them principally you vanquiſht your Enemyes. Not onely he who ſends his neighbour aydes, is a freind and an Aſſociate, but he alſo who readily furniſhes him for the warr with neceſſaryes. Conſider how then your Navy had no place to put into, but <hi>Sicily,</hi> nor could go into <hi>Affrick</hi> without what was there bought. So that the principall cauſe of your Victory is from us; who releiving you in time of need, may lay a clayme to the good ſucceſſe: and what greater contentment, O! Emperour, could you have, then to ſubdue your Enemyes? nay it is a great wrong to us, not to receive ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50471:78"/>to the Law of War, our ſhare in the ſpoyles: Whereas you ſeek to take <hi>Lilyboeum</hi> from us, long appertaining to the <hi>Goths,</hi> and a poor Rock not worth the money (in caſe it did belong to your Empire) which in reaſon you ought to recompence <hi>Atalarick</hi> with, for aſſiſting you in your greateſt needs.</q> Thus <hi>Amalaſuntha</hi> wrote publickly, but in private promiſed to deliver <hi>Italy</hi> to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour; to whom the Ambaſſadors at their Return to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> related all; <hi>Alexander</hi> concerning <hi>Amalaſuntha's</hi> Reſolution; and <hi>Demetrius</hi> and <hi>Hypatius,</hi> what they had in truſt from <hi>Theodutus,</hi> and how having great power in <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> and being Lord of a large Countrey, he could eaſily performe his promiſes. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour being over joyed with it, ſent forthwith into <hi>Italy, Peter,</hi> an <hi>Illyrian</hi> by Race, but borne in <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> and an Oratour in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> a wife, milde man, and of great ability to perſwade. In the mean time the <hi>Tuſcans</hi> accuſed <hi>Theodatus</hi> to <hi>Amalaſuntha</hi> for his oppreſſions; and for intruding not onely into the Lands of common perſons, but into the Royall domeans, called <hi>Patrimonium. Amalaſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha</hi> called him to his anſwer, and upon expreſſe conviction; compelled him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore his unlawfull Intruſions, which infinitely offended <hi>Theodatus,</hi> and made him her Enemy, being vexed that hee could not uſe his ſinne of oppreſſion. About the ſame time <hi>Atalarick</hi> dyed of his conſumption, having raigned eight years. And <hi>Amalaſuntha</hi> (ordayned for a miſcheife) without conſidering <hi>Theodatus</hi> nature, nor her late proceeding againſt him, imagined by ſome extraordinary good Turne to oblige him from hurting her. She ſent for him, and to appeaſe him, told him; <q>That ſhe had long foreſeene her Sonnes end, by the dayly waſting of his Body, and the opinion of the Phyſitians; that ſhe found the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> inclined to him, being of <hi>Theodoricks</hi> blood; That ſhee endeavored therefore to purge him of aſperſions, which might hinder his calling to the Kingdome; that ſhee was alſo troubled in the point of Juſtice, if men wrong'd ſhould complayne, to have none to make their caſes knowne to, but to have their Adverſary their Lord. But now being clear, ſhee invited him to the Kingdom: But they muſt binde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by ſolemne oathes, for him to continue the name of King, and her ſelfe to continue her former power.</q> 
                  <hi>Theodatus</hi> ſwore what ſhee pleaſed, with a falſe Intent, remembring how ſhee had uſed him formerly.

                  <hi>THeodatus</hi> being in poſſeſſion of the Kingdome, did quite contrary to her hopes, and his own Ingagements. He drew to him many principall <hi>Goths,</hi> kinſmen to ſuch as ſhee had put to death; ſome of <hi>Amalaſuntha's</hi> party he ſuddenly killed, and put her ſelfe in ſafe cuſtody in a ſtrong caſtle in an Iſland upon the Lake of <hi>Vulſinus</hi> in <hi>Tuſcany.</hi> But fearing that the Emperour might be offended at it, (as indeed he was) he ſent <hi>Liberius</hi> and <hi>Opilio,</hi> two Senators of <hi>Rome,</hi> and others to make his Excuſes, and to aſſure the Emperour, that <hi>Amalaſuntha</hi> had no harme, though ſhee had done him extreame Injury formerly. This he wrote to the Emperour, and made <hi>Amalaſuntha</hi> write as much. The Emperour in the meane time had inſtructed <hi>Peter</hi> to get private ſpeech with <hi>Theodatus,</hi> and to give his Oath to conceal the negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo to make <hi>Tuſcany</hi> ſure; to deale likewiſe with <hi>Amalaſuntha,</hi> and to conclude for all <hi>Italy,</hi> but publickly to pretend his Ambaſſage for <hi>Lilyboeum,</hi> and the reſt before mentioned. For of the death of <hi>Atalarick,</hi> or ſucceſſion of <hi>Theoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> or of the Fortune of <hi>Amalaſuntha,</hi> the Emperour had not yet heard. <hi>Peter</hi> upon the way met <hi>Amalaſuntha's</hi> Ambaſſadors, and heard of the Succeſſion of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odatus.</hi> Shortly after at <hi>Appollonia</hi> upon the <hi>Jonian</hi> gulfe he met with <hi>Liberius</hi> and <hi>Opilìo;</hi> and was informed of all the paſſages. He advertiſed the Emperour, and ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there: Who thereupon intending to imbroyle <hi>Theodatus</hi> and the <hi>Goths,</hi> wrote Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to <hi>Amalaſuntha,</hi> of his Reſolution to take her part, and ſent inſtructions to <hi>Peter</hi> to profeſſe the ſame openly to <hi>Theodatus,</hi> and all the <hi>Goths;</hi> Whoſe Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50471:79"/>being arrived at <hi>Conſtantinople, Liberius,</hi> who was a very honeſt man, and carefull to ſpeake no untruth, and the reſt acquainted the Emperour with the whole matter; onely <hi>Opilio</hi> proteſted that <hi>Theodatus</hi> had not wronged the perſon of <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuntha.</hi> But before <hi>Peter</hi> came into <hi>Italy, Amalaſuntha</hi> was murdered; The kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of thoſe put to death by her alledging to <hi>Theodatus,</hi> that neither he, nor they could be ſafe, if ſhee were not made out of the way. So with his permiſſion, they went to the Iſland, and killed her. Which much greived the reſt of the <hi>Goths,</hi> and all the <hi>Italians.</hi> For (as I ſayd before) ſhee was a woman ſtrongly bent to all kinde of virtue. <hi>Peter</hi> proteſted openly to <hi>Theodatus</hi> and the <hi>Goths,</hi> that for this foule fact there ſhould be implacable war between the Emperour and them. <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datus</hi> was ſo abſurd, as albeit he graced <hi>Amalaſuntha's</hi> Murderers, yet he would perſwade <hi>Peter,</hi> and the Emperour, that the villany was committed by no allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his, but much againſt his will.</p>

                  <hi>THeodatus</hi> ſubſcribed the accord, and diſmiſt the <hi>Ambaſſadour;</hi> but preſently his cowardize drave him to endleſſe feares, and the thought of a Warre vexed him, which he inſtantly expected, if the <hi>Emperour</hi> ſhould not allow the ſayd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. He ſent for <hi>Peter,</hi> being gone as far as into <hi>Albania,</hi> ſecretly to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate ſomething to him; and ask't <q>him, if he thought the Emperour would like the accord; who anſwered, that he thought ſo. But if he do not, ſaid the other, what will follow? A warre Noble Sir, quoth <hi>Peter.</hi> And is that juſt? replyed he; Why not juſt (quoth <hi>Peter</hi>) for every man to be conſtant in his own addictions? <hi>Theodatus</hi> askt, what he meant by that? Becauſe, quoth he, your addiction is to Philoſophy; and the Emperour <hi>Juſtinians</hi> to be Noble; The difference is, that for you, profeſſing Philoſophy, and that from the Schoole of <hi>Plato,</hi> to cauſe the death of ſo many men, is not decent, but wicked, not to be abſolutely cleere of murder;</q> But for him to challenge the ancient appurtenances of his Empire, is not unreaſonable. <hi>Theodatus</hi> perſwaded by the advice, agreed to quit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to <hi>Juſtinian;</hi> and to that effect himſelfe and his Wife took their Oaths; and he bound <hi>Peter</hi> by oath not to diſcover this to the Emperour, before he perceived him not to accept the former accord; and with him he ſent <hi>Ruſticus,</hi> a Prieſt, a <hi>Roman</hi> borne, and his Favourite. Theſe at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> acquainted the Emperour with the firſt accord; who not accepting the conditions, they ſhewed the ſecond agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, contained in a letter written by him, thus. I am no ſtranger to a Court, O <q>Emperour I being born in the Palace of the King mine Unkle, and bred as became my birth. Indeed in the tumults of War I have no skill, my love of learning and exerciſes therein, have removed me from the noiſe of Battailes. So that I have no reaſon to be ambitious of Kingdomes, nor to live in dangers, having meanes to avoid both, neither pleaſing me. The firſt, as all other ſweets, being ever pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht with ſatiety: And the other, vexing a man that is not uſed to it. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I may have lands in poſſeſſion of the yearly value of 12. <hi>Centenaries</hi> of gold, I ſhall prefer them before a Kingdome; and will ſurrender to you the Dominion of the <hi>Goths.</hi> and <hi>Italians.</hi> I ſhall be more contented to live a Husband-man, then in the cares and multiplying dangers of a Kingdome. Send to me therefore ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſome man, to whom I may reſign <hi>Italy,</hi> and the State.</q> The Emperour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely over-joyed, returned this anſwer. I ever took you for a wiſe man, and <q>now my experience aſſures it, in that you depend not on the uncertaine event of a War, by which ſome have undone themſelves already; and you ſhall never repent for having made us a friend of an Enemy; your demands you ſhall have, with this addition, to be advanced to the prime honours of the <hi>Roman</hi> State. I have ſent <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> to make our ſelves ſure by ſome Articles; and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſarius</hi> ſhall be ſpeedily ſent to put a concluſion thereunto.</q> The Emperour ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly ſent <hi>Athanaſius</hi> brother to that <hi>Alexander</hi> lately ſent Ambaſſador to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talaricus,</hi> and the afore-named <hi>Peter,</hi> with Inſtructions, to allot lands to <hi>Theodatus</hi> of the Emperours Demeans; and having by writings and oath perfected the accord; to call in <hi>Beliſarius</hi> from <hi>Sicily</hi> to take poſſeſſion of the Imperiall Palaces, and <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and the cuſtody thereof: And he directed <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> being ſent for, inſtantly to go over.</p>
               <p>During this negotiation, an Army of <hi>Goths</hi> led by <hi>Aſinarius,</hi> and <hi>Gripas,</hi> entred <hi>Dalmatia;</hi> and neer <hi>Salonae</hi> were encountred by <hi>Mauritius</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Mundus,</hi> who with a few went out to diſcover only.

But <hi>Mundus</hi> killing and chaſing at adventure, as enraged for the loſſe of his ſonne, was wounded and ſlain by a Run-away; Whereupon the Execution ceaſed, and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies parted. Then did the <hi>Romans</hi> remember a verſe of <hi>Sibyll,</hi> famous, and ſeeming formerly to foretel ſome ſtrange prodigie; That when <hi>Affricke</hi> ſhould again come under the <hi>Romans,</hi> Mundus <hi>cum ſuo ſemine interibit.</hi> But in the Oracle it was not ſo expreſt; but having intimated the ſaid return of <hi>Affricke,</hi> it ſayes <hi>Quod tunc</hi> Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus <hi>cum filio interibit. Mundus</hi> ſignifying the world in Latine, they conceived it to be meant of the world. But into <hi>Salonae</hi> no man entred; The <hi>Romans</hi> deſtitute of a Generall retired home; and the <hi>Goths,</hi> having loſt their cheife men, kept cloſe in their Garriſons, having no confidence in the Fortifications of <hi>Salonae,</hi> and the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> inhabiting it being not their friends. <hi>Theodatus</hi> upon the newes hereof ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Ambaſſadors, being naturally ſlippery and faithleſſe; The preſent fortune ever drew him either into ſenſeleſs fears not ſutable to the occaſion, or into exceſſive preſumption. As now upon the newes of <hi>Mundus,</hi> and <hi>Mauritius,</hi> he was exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not proportionably to the accident, and he flowted the Ambaſſadors, being now with him. <hi>Peter</hi> once expoſtulating his breach of agreements, he called him into publique, and ſaid, <q>That Ambaſſadors indeed are perſons of reſpect, and by all men honoured; but that they preſerve this priviledge, and the honour of their places by moderation onely. For men uſe to put an Ambaſſador to death if he demeane himſelf inſolently to a Kings perſon, or lye with another mans Wife.</q> 
                  <hi>Theodatus</hi> ſaid not thus, as thinking <hi>Peter</hi> to kave layen with any mans Wife; but to ſhew that there were crimes in an Ambaſſador puniſhable with death. But the Ambaſſadors made him this anſwer. <q>O Prince of the <hi>Goths!</hi> upon ſuch miſtaken, unſound pretences do not you violate the perſons of Ambaſſadors. An Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador, if he would, cannot be an Adulterer; who can hardly have ſo much as the uſe of water, without the privity of thoſe that guard him. For words (though harſh) if he utter ſuch as he received from his Maſter, not he, but his Maſter is to beare the blame; An Ambaſſadors onely part is, to execute the ſervice. And we, what we have received from the Emperour, will utter it all, and you are pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently to heare us. If you be angry, you have no help, but to abuſe men that are Ambaſſadors. It is high time for you to perform your Covenants with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour; For which purpoſe we are ſent hither. His letters to your ſelfe you have; another, directed to the principall <hi>Goths,</hi> we will deliver only to themſelves. The great Officers being preſent, bad them give the Letter to <hi>Theodatus;</hi> which was thus. Our care is, to receive you into our State; for which you ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce; For you ſhall mingle with us, not for your diminution, but to adde more value to you. We invite not the <hi>Goths</hi> to Countries ſtrange, and unknown to them; but to our ſelves, ſometimes their familiars, though for a time divided from them. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> are ſent about this buſineſſe, whom you are to aſſiſt in all things.</q>

                  <q>It is not juſt, O Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall! to bring your Army upon <hi>Romans,</hi> and who never wrong'd you, having a ſmall Citie, and the <hi>Barbarians</hi> within our Maſters; that we cannot do as we would: Nay the Souldiers of our Garriſon have leſt under <hi>Theodatus</hi> their Wives and Children, and moſt precious things, that by practiſing upon us, they ſhould not more betray our Town, then themſelves. But if we may ſay the truth without mincing, you have adviſed ill to invade us. For take <hi>Rome</hi> firſt, and <hi>Naples</hi> is yours without difficulty; but repulſed from thence, you can never be ſure of this Towne. So that you will ſpend time impertinently in this ſiege. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſarius</hi> made <hi>Stephanus</hi> this anſwer. We meane not to referre it to the <hi>Napoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> whether We be here upon good, or bad advice. We deſire you to conſult of what concerns your ſelves, and to chooſe your owne beſt advantage. Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine therefore the Emperours Armie, come to free you and all <hi>Italy;</hi> and doe not prefer the moſt ſorrowfull things. Such as make War to ſhake off ſlavery, or other baſe condition, gaine in vanquiſhing, with the victory, freedome from
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50471:81"/>miſery; and being vanquiſhed are yet comforted for not having willingly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to a wretched fortune. But ſuch as may be free without fighting, and yet will fight to eſtabliſh their own ſervitude; if they conquer, they do but more ruine themſelves; and if they have the worſe, they adde to their other wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the calamity of a defeate. This he ſayd to the <hi>Napolitans.</hi> To the <hi>Goths</hi> we give Liberty either to ſerve the Emperour with us, or to retire home with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out harme. If you ſlight all this, and imploy your armes againſt us, we ſhall uſe you as Enemies: But if the <hi>Napolitans</hi> will joyne with the Emperour, and be rid of a ſharpe ſervitude; I will pawn my faith for ſuch conditions, as the <hi>Sicilians</hi> had, who cannot ſay we are forſworne.</q> This <hi>Beliſarius</hi> commanded <hi>Stephanus</hi> to impart to the people; promiſing him great rewards, if he drew them to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour. <hi>Stephanus</hi> acquainted the City with theſe propoſitions, and with his owne opinion of the inconvenience of reſiſting the Emperour.

               <p>BUt <hi>Paſtor</hi> and <hi>Aſclepiodotus,</hi> two Orators much eſteemed in <hi>Naples,</hi> and freinds to the <hi>Goths,</hi> to croſſe the treaty, drew the people to propound great things, and many, and that <hi>Beliſarius</hi> would ſwear to their preſent obtaining the ſame: And they gave to <hi>Stephanus</hi> demands in writing, which they thought <hi>Beliſarius</hi> would never yeild to. He went to the Camp, ſhewed the writing to the Generall, demanding if he would grant thoſe propoſitions, and take his Oath accordingly. He promiſed to grant all, and ſent him away. The <hi>Napolitans</hi> imbraced the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation, and commanded the army to be received into the City: which (ſaid they) may ſafely be done, the <hi>Sicilians</hi> giving us ample proofe, who for <hi>Barbarian</hi> Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants have choſen the Empire of <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> and are become free men, and eaſed of all greivance. And then in much tumult they went to open the gates; which troubled the <hi>Goths:</hi> but being not able to hinder it, they kept out of the way. But <hi>Paſtor</hi> and <q>
                     <hi>Aſclepiodotus</hi> aſſembled the people, and ſpake thus. It is not ſtrange for a City-multitude to ruine it ſelfe, when they will reſolve in the generall abſolutely, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out communicating with the better ſort. But being with you upon the point of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, we cannot but contribute this laſt adviſe to our country. You are run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to deliver your ſelves, and City to <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> who promiſes much, and will ſolemnly ſwear to it. If he could aſſure you, that he ſhall conquer in this war, no man can gainſay, but that theſe things will be good for us. It were fooliſh not to gratifie him that is to be our Lord; but ſince this is uncertaine, and ſince none can ſecure the Reſolutions of Fortune; conſider for what miſeries you may take this pains. For the <hi>Goths</hi> overcoming, wil puniſh you for having done them the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt deſpight, revolting thus not forced by neceſſity, but as willing cowards. Nay even <hi>Beliſarius</hi> himſelf being Victor will eſteeme us falſe and Traitors to our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and as ſuch, we muſt expect a perpetuall garriſon upon us. A Traitors ſervice pleaſes for the preſent with the victory obtained, but afterward the Victor ſuſpects, fears, and hates his Benefactor, having with him the marks of his falſhood. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing true to the <hi>Goths,</hi> and valiant in this danger, if they conquer, they will do us many good turnes; and <hi>Beliſarius</hi> getting the victory will pardon us. No un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding man will puniſh a good affection failing of ſucceſſe. And why fear you this ſeige? being in no wants, nor blockt up; but at home, ſecured by theſe walls and ſouldiers? If <hi>Beliſarius</hi> could hope to force us, he would not come to this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation: and if he would do juſtly, and us good, he would not fright us thus, and eſtabliſh a power upon our wronging the <hi>Goths,</hi> but come roundly to a battell with them, that we without danger or Treaſon might follow the Conquerour. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus ſaid, they produced <hi>Jewes,</hi> who aſſured the town ſhould want nothing: and the <hi>Goths</hi> promiſed to guard them ſafely. Wherewith perſwaded, they defied <hi>Beliſarius;</hi> who fell to aſſault, and was often repulſed with loſie of many, and even
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50471:81"/>of his valianteſt men.</q> For the walls what by reaſon of the ſea, and for the ſteepe ground, were unacceſſible, and not to be approacht by an enemy. And the cutting of the <hi>Aquaeduct</hi> by <hi>Beliſarius</hi> troubled not the <hi>Napolitans</hi> much, their wells within ſupplying their uſes: And they ſent to <hi>Theodatus</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> to ſend them ſuccours. <hi>Theodatus</hi> being a coward (as I have ſaid) made little preparation for a warre: and he had an accident (they ſay, but not credibly to my conceit) which put him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to great fear. <hi>Theodatus</hi> was acquainted ever with men thar pretend to foretell things to come; and being now perplexed with the preſent affaires (when men uſe moſt to runne after propheſies) he askt an <hi>Hebrew,</hi> famous for ſuch things, what would be the event of the War. He directed him to ſhut up three halfe ſcores of Hoggs ſeverally, and to each ten to give ſeverall names, of <hi>Goths, Romans,</hi> and the Emperours Souldiers, and ſo for a certain number of dayes to let them alone. <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odatus</hi> at the appointed day went to the ſties, to ſee the Hoggs. Thoſe which were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Goths,</hi> he found all dead, ſave two: Thoſe called the Emperours Souldiers, were allmoſt all alive: And thoſe who bare the name of <hi>Romans</hi> were halfe living, and all with their haires fallen off. <hi>Theodatus</hi> by this divined the ſucceſſe of the war, and was affraid: perceiving that one halfe of the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould periſh, and all looſe their Eſtates; that the <hi>Goths</hi> ſhould be vanquiſht; and reduced to a ſmall rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and that the Emperour ſhould get the victory with the loſſe of few. Upon this he was affraid to fight with <hi>Beliſarius;</hi> who beſieging <hi>Naples</hi> was troubled, not thinking it would yeild, and being not able to force the difficulty of the place: and his loſſe to time vexed him, fearing to be put to ſet upon <hi>Theodatus</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> in the winter.

               <p>AN <hi>Iſaurian,</hi> curious to ſee the ſtructure of the Aquaeduct, and how it brought water to the City, entred it far from the city where <hi>Beliſarius</hi> had cut it; (which had made it dry) and being come in neer to the town-wall, he met with a Rock to which the Aquaeduct was joyned, and through it was cut a vault, not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for a man to enter, but only to let through the water; ſo that there the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaeduct was not paſſable, eſpecially by a man armed with ſheild and corſlet. The <hi>Iſaurian</hi> obſerving it, conceived that by widening the vault, forces might enter; and being himſelf an obſcure man, unknown to the Commanders, he revealed it to <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caris,</hi> a Targettier of the guard to <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> who told it to <hi>Beliſarius;</hi> and he revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with the newes promiſed the man mony, and perſwaded him to take ſome <hi>Iſau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> and with ſpeed and ſecrecy to cut the rock wider. <hi>Paucaris,</hi> with ſome choice Iſaurians fit to worke, entred ſilently the Aquaeduct, and being come to the Rock and narrow Vault, they wrought, not cutting it with hatchets and axes, leſt the noiſe ſhould diſcover them, but paring and filing it with inſtruments of iron; and in ſhort time there was roome for a man with his ſheild and corſlet on to go through. All being ready, <hi>Beliſarius</hi> conſidered, how the army entring by force, there would be ſlaughter and ſuch things as befall places forced by Enemies. He ſent therefore <q>for <hi>Stephanus,</hi> and ſayd to him thus. I have been at the taking of many Cities, and and am acquainted with the uſuall accidents therein. They kill the men of all ages; the women they vouchſafe not to kill, though they beg it, but lead them away for baſe and pitifull uſes. The children without other Education muſt learne to ſerve their greateſt enemies, whoſe hands are ſtained with their Fathers bloud. I ſpeake not of the fire which wil conſume your goods, and the beauty of your city. Behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as in a glaſſe in other ruined cities, the miſeries of <hi>Naples,</hi> I pity it. For my engins are ready, wherewith I ſhall not faile to take it. And while I am Generall; I would not have an ancient city, long inhabited with Chriſtians and Romans, come to this fortune: the rather having in the army <hi>Barbarians,</hi> enraged for the loſſe of brothers and kindred, whom I ſhall not be able to reſtraine; if they enter by hoſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</q> So that chuſe the beſt for your ſelves while you may, and avoyd this calamity; which happening (as it will) blame not fortune, but your owne Counſells. <hi>Stepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:50471:82"/>weeping, reported to the People this Speech of <hi>Beliſarius:</hi> But they (whoſe Subjection to the Emperour was to be accompanied with their miſchiefe) feared not, nor thought of yeilding.</p>
               <p>Then did <hi>Beliſarius</hi> about Evening chuſe out 400. men, and gave the Command of them to <hi>Magnus,</hi> a Captaine of Horſe, and <hi>Ennes,</hi> Commander of the <hi>Iſaurians,</hi> whom he directed to ſtand ready with their Corſelets on, and with Swords and Shields, till he ſhould give the Signall. And he ſent for <hi>Beſſas,</hi> to adviſe with him of ſome things of Importance. Far within night, he told <hi>Magnus</hi> and <hi>Ennes</hi> the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſhewed them the place, where he had cut the Aquaeduct, and commanded affright the Towne, and to ſignifie to him what they did. Himſelfe had many ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Ladders in readineſſe. They entred the Aquaeduct, and went towards the Town, and himſelfe, with <hi>Beſſas</hi> and <hi>Photius,</hi> ſtaid in the place, directing the Army to ſtand with their Armes ready; and keeping many of the Valianteſt men about himſelfe. More then the one halfe who were to enter, apprehending the danger, came back to the Generall, and <hi>Magnus</hi> with them: after much exhorting them to go on, but not prevailing, <hi>Beliſarius</hi> rated them, and gave <hi>Magnus</hi> 200. other of his owne Retinew, whom <hi>Photius</hi> would have led, and firſt entred the vault; but <hi>Beliſarius</hi> forbad him. The Run-awaies aſhamed at the reprehenſions of <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> took hart, and followed the reſt. <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> leaſt the Enemies ſentinels upon the Turret next the Aquaeduct ſhould diſcover them, went thither, and bad <hi>Beſſas</hi> talke with the <hi>Goths</hi> in their owne Language, that they might not heare the claſhing of the Armes. <hi>Beſſas</hi> aloud called to them to yeild, promiſing many Advantages; And they flouted him with ſcornefull Speeches againſt <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> and the Emperour. The Aquaeduct is not onely covered without the Walls, but ſo continues with a high Arch of Brick a great way within; that <hi>Magnus</hi> and <hi>Ennes</hi> being within the City, could not imagine where-about they were, nor finde where to get up, till their fore-moſt men came, where they found the Roofe uncovered, and where ſtood a Cottage, and in it dwelt a Woman alone, and very poore; and at the top of the Aquaeduct grew an Olive Tree. The men perceiving the Skie, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the midſt of the City, would willingly get up, but could not with their Armes, the Building being high, and without Steps. Being long in doubt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to be crowded with the Company preſſing behinde them; one of them, having a minde to make triall, laid downe his Armes, and clambered up; and finding the poore Woman in the Cottage, threatned to kill her, if ſhe made any noiſe. She aſtoniſht, ſate mute; and he tying a Rope to the Olive Tree, threw the other end into the Aquaeduct, by which the Souldiers mounted one by one. All being up, and but a fourth part of the Night remaining, they aſcended the Wall, and killed the Sentinels upon two Turrets on the North ſide, where <hi>Beliſarius, Beſſas,</hi> and <hi>Photius</hi> ſtood expecting the Event. They called them to the Walls with their Trumpets, and <hi>Beliſarius</hi> ſet to the ſcaling Ladders, commanding the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to mount. The Ladders were too ſhort, the Work-men having not made them upon view, and ſo not judging of a juſt ſcantling. But they tied two together, and ſo mounted the Battlements. That part of the Walls next the Sea, where the <hi>Jewes</hi> guarded, the Souldiers could not aſcend. For the <hi>Jewes</hi> had offended the Enemy, in hindering a peaceable ſurrender of the Towne, and ſo being hopeleſſe, (if ſubdued) they fought valiantly, though the Towne were entered; and they indured beyond Expectation. But day appearing, and being charged behinde by ſome who were entred already, they fled; and <hi>Naples</hi> was abſolutely taken, and the Gates ſet open; where the reſt of the Army entred. Thoſe who were quartered Eaſtward, having no Ladders, burnt open the Gates there, the Guards being all run away. A great Slaughter was made; all being angry, and eſpecially ſuch as had Brothers, or Kinſ-men ſlaine in the former Aſſaults, and they killed all, ſparing no Age; broke into the Houſes, and made the Women and Children Slaves, and pillaged the Goods; principally the <hi>Maſſagetes,</hi> who ſpared not the Churches, but killed many who fled into them; till <hi>Beliſarius</hi> rode about and reſtrained them, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling <q>the Army, ſpake thus. Since God hath given us Victory, and the glory of ſubduing a City, heretofore impregnable; let us not prove unworthy of the Favour, but by our Clemency to the Vanquiſhed, make it appeare, that we have
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50471:82"/>juſtly overcome them. Do not without limit extend your hatred to the <hi>Napoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> beyond the Rules of War. No Conquerours continue hating the Vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; if you kill them now, you are not rid of Enemies, but indamaged by the death fo your Subjects. So that do them no further harm, nor gratifie you owne Anger. It is baſe, having conquered your Enemies, to be overcome by your owne Paſſion. Take the Wealth, as the Reward of your Valour; but reſtore the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Children, and let the Conquered finde by the Events, what kinde of Friends they loſt by their owne ill Counſels.</q> 
                  <hi>Beliſarius</hi> having thus ſaid, releaſed all their Women and Children, and other Priſoners, without enduring any Diſhonour, and reconciled the Souldiers to them. So in the ſame day the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans</hi> had the Fortune to be made Slaves, and to recover their Liberty, with the moſt precious of their Goods; having hid their Gold, and things of Value from the Enemy, under ground, and ſo found them upon the Reſtitution of their Houſes. Thus ended this Seige, having laſted twenty daies.</p>

               <p>But the <hi>Goths</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> and other Townes that way, wondred to ſee <hi>Theodatus</hi> ſo tame, not offering to fight with the <hi>Romans,</hi> being his ſo neere Neighbours: And they ſuſpected him to betray their State to <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> caring onely to live at eaſe himſelfe, and to be rich.

The place they found fit to encamp in, being neere to a faire Champian, and to the River of <hi>Decanovius,</hi> ſo called, becauſe having made a compaſſe of 19. miles, it enters the Sea about the City of <hi>Taracina.</hi> Neere unto which is the Mountaine <hi>Circaeum,</hi> where they ſay <hi>

                  <hi>VItigis</hi> then marcht to <hi>Rome,</hi> glad of the newes of <hi>Theodatus</hi> Death, and he put his Son <hi>Theudegiſclus</hi> in ſafe Cuſtody.

The <hi>Goths</hi> approved this adviſe of <hi>Vitigis,</hi> and prepared for the Journey.

               </p>
               <p>The two Nations being joyned thus in allyance, who had married any Wife of the other, might either goe with his Wife, or bring her home to his owne kindred; And ſome (as they pleaſed) brought home their Wives, others followed them. <hi>Amalarick</hi> afterward offended his Wives brother, and was ruined.

               <p>IN the meane time <hi>Vitigis</hi> hearing of the ſmalneſſe of <hi>Beliſarius</hi> his Army, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented him for retiring from <hi>Rome;</hi> ſo not enduring longer where he was, in much anger he marcht thitherward. Upon the way he met a <hi>Roman</hi> Preiſt, of whom, they ſay, he ask'd earneſtly, if <hi>Beliſarius</hi> were yet at <hi>Rome;</hi> as fearing not to catch him before his running away. He bad him apprehend no ſuch thing, undertaking that <hi>Beliſarius</hi> would not fly, but ſtay upon the place: Which made him haſt the more; openly praying, to ſee <hi>Rome</hi> before <hi>Beliſarius</hi> were run out of it. Who hearing the whole Nation of <hi>Goths</hi> thus coming upon him, was troubled; For though his Army were very ſmall, he would not leave deſtitute <hi>Conſtantinus</hi> and <hi>Beſſas,</hi> nor abandon the places in <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> leaſt with them the <hi>Goths</hi> ſhould block up <hi>Rome.</hi> So upon advice he ſent to <hi>Conſtantinus,</hi> and <hi>Beſſas,</hi> to leave competent Garriſons in the moſt important places, and with the reſt to come to <hi>Rome. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinus</hi> accordingly placing Garriſons in <hi>Spoletum</hi> and <hi>Peruſia,</hi> came with the reſt to <hi>Rome.</hi> But <hi>Beſſas</hi> ſtaying to ſettle <hi>Narnia,</hi> the Enemy paſſed that way, and the Feilds and Suburbs were full of them, being <hi>Avant-coureurs,</hi> whom <hi>Beſſas</hi> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and defeated them, and killed many; but preſt with their numbers, he reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into <hi>Narnia,</hi> where he left a Garriſon; and coming to <hi>Rome,</hi> brought newes, that the Enemie would ſpeedily be with them. <hi>Narnia</hi> ſtands almoſt 44. miles from <hi>Rome. Vitigis</hi> would not ſpend time upon <hi>Peruſia,</hi> and <hi>Spoletum,</hi> being ſtrong places. His deſire was to find <hi>Beliſarius</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> before he was run away. And <hi>Narnia</hi> poſſeſt by the Enemy, and a place ſteep and hard of acceſſe, he would not ſtir neither: it ſtands on a high hill, at the foot whereof is the River of <hi>Narnus,</hi> giving the name to the City; and it hath two aſcents on the Eaſt and Weſt ſides; the one narrow with ragged rocks; to the other is no coming, but over the bridge upon the River, which is an ancient building of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> admirable to ſee, and with the higheſt arches we know. <hi>Vitigis,</hi> not to ſpend time, ſpeedily went thence with his whole Army toward <hi>Rome,</hi> marching through the <hi>Sabins</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. Being within a mile and three quarters thereof, he came to a bridg upon the <hi>Tiber,</hi> where <hi>Beliſarius</hi> had built a Tower, and Gates, and placed a Garriſon. The <hi>Tiber</hi> was every where paſſable by Boats and other Bridges; but this he did, to put the Enemy to more delay (expecting from the Emperour more Forces) and that the <hi>Romans</hi> might have the more time to bring in proviſions; conceiving that the <hi>Goths</hi> repulſed here, could not paſſe by any other Bridge in leſſe then twenty days; and to get Boats would be a longer worke.</p>
               <p>Upon theſe conſiderations he placed that Garriſon. The <hi>Goths</hi> lodged neer it, and the next day intended to aſſault the Tower. Here came to them 22. Fugitives, <hi>Barbarians</hi> born, but <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers of <hi>Innocentius</hi> Horſe-troop. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> thought fit to make a Camp neer the <hi>Tiber,</hi> the more to hinder the Enemies paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and to give ſome demonſtration of their own courage.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Garriſon upon the Bridg frighted with the multitude, and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, quitted the Tower at night, and ran away into <hi>Campania.</hi> They would not goe to <hi>Rome,</hi> fearing chaſtiſement from the Generall, or aſhamed to ſee their fellowes. The next day the <hi>Goths</hi> brake down the Gates, and paſſed over, none oppoſing. Whereof <hi>Beliſarius</hi> hearing nothing, with 1000. Horſe marcht toward the bridg, to view their ground, where they might beſt incamp; who lighting upon the Enemy newly paſſed over, were engaged in a fight unwillingly. They were both ſides Horſe: And <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> though formerly cautions, obſerved not then the ranck of a Generall, but fought in the head of his Souldiers, which hazarded extreamly the <hi>Roman</hi> affairs, the whole inclination of the War depending on him. But he was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Horſe uſed to the War, and skilfull to ſave his Rider. He was of a brown bay, and from the fore-head to the noſtrils white (Such a Horſe the <hi>Grecians</hi> call <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Thoſe new-come Fugitives ſeeing <hi>Beliſarius</hi> fighting in the firſt ranck, &amp; knowing that by his fall the <hi>Romans</hi> would be ruined, cryed aloud to ſhoot at the bald fac'd Horſe. This word ran through the <hi>Goths</hi> Army, who in the tumult
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50471:86"/>being not inquiſitive, nor certain it was <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> but gueſſing the word ſo general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpred was not for nothing, moſt left all others, and ſhot at <hi>Beliſarius.</hi> Such as were ventrous, and ambitious of honour, got neer, reacht at him, and in fury layd on with Lances and ſwords. And <hi>Beliſarius</hi> layd about him too, killing thoſe within his reach. The affection of his Lanciers and Targetiers ſtood him in good ſtead in this danger; who ſticking cloſe to him, ſhewed valour, the like whereof (I think) was never ſeen, holding their ſheilds before the Generall, and receiving all the arrowes, and thruſting off the multitudes with main ſtrength.</p>

               <p>THus was the whole fight about one man, wherein fell at leaſt 1000 <hi>Goths,</hi> and ſuch as fought in the firſt rancks. Many of the beſt of <hi>Beliſarius</hi> his Retinue were ſlaine, and <hi>Maxentius,</hi> one of his Lanciers, after he had performed bravely: Himſelfe was neither wounded that day nor ſhot, though the fight was about him alone. In concluſion, the Romans routed the Enemy; multitudes flying, till they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered their campe: where their foot being freſh, received the Romans, and eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repulſed them. Who ſeeing another ſupply of Horſe coming, fled up to a Hill, where they made a ſtand; and encounter'd the Barbarian horſe overtaking them. Where <hi>Valentinus,</hi> Gentleman of the horſe to <hi>Photius, Antonina's</hi> ſonne, ſhewed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary valour, gallopping into the thickeſt of the enemy, and ſtopping their courſe, and bringing off his company; and thus they eſcaped to the Walls of <hi>Rome,</hi> with the Barbarians at their heels up to the gate, now called <hi>Beliſaria.</hi> The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans within, fearing the Enemy might enter pell mell, would not open the gate, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding <hi>Beliſarius's</hi> earneſt commands, loud cries, and threats, who could not be diſcerned from the Turret (it being after Sun ſet) having his face covered with bloud and duſt, and they did not think the Generall to be alive; thoſe that ran away at the firſt defeat having reported him to be ſlain, fighting bravely in the head of his troopes. The Enemy therefore coming with multitudes, and much Fury, thought to get over the ditch, and charged the retirers, who near the Walls ſtood thick and cloſe body to body in a ſmall roome. And they within being no Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, nor prepared at all, and afraide of their city, could not ſuccour them; when a ſudden bold reſolution of <hi>Beliſarius</hi> ſaved all, who encouraging his company, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Enemy: and they being diſordered, as in the dark, and upon a chaſe, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe that fled unexpectedly coming on, ſuſpected ſuccours to be come from the city, and in a fear run all away. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> purſued them not, but turned about to the walls; whom the Romans, taking heart, received in, and his company. In ſo great pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill was <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> and the Emperours affaires. The fight beginning in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ended at night; wherein <hi>Beliſarius</hi> did beſt of the Romans, and of the Goths <hi>Viſandus</hi> the ſtandard bearer, who with the reſt charged <hi>Beliſarius;</hi> and went not off, before hee fel to the ground after 13 wounds received, and neglected by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions (though they had the victory) he was left among the dead. Three dayes after, the Goths being encamped neer <hi>Rome,</hi> ſent out to bury the dead men, and to performe their funerall rites: theſe ſearching the bodies, found <hi>Viſandus</hi> with breath in him, but he could not ſpeak; his inward parts with famin and drouth being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly inflamed, they put water in his mouth, and ſo having drunk and got life, they carried him to the campe; and for this he was in great reputation with the Goths, and he lived long after. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> being in ſafety, aſſembled his ſouldiers to the walls, and moſt of the common people; commanding them to light fires, and to watch all night. He went the round himſelf, ſet all in order, and appointed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders to every gate. <hi>Beſſas,</hi> who guarded <hi>Porta Praeneſtina,</hi> ſent him word, that the town was entred by the Enemy at a gate bearing the name from Saint <hi>Pancra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</hi> The company adviſed <hi>Beliſarius</hi> to eſcape out at ſome other gate; but hee miſliked the motion, ſent horſemen down to the <hi>Tiber,</hi> who upon the view brought word, that there was no Enemy thereabout appearing. Wherefore he ſent directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Commanders of every gate, if they heard that the Enemie was entred at any other part, not to ſuccour, but to continue upon their guards; leaſt they ſhould be
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50471:87"/>diſordered with falſe alarms; Himſelf would take care of thoſe things. <hi>Vitigis</hi> (the Romans being in this tumult) ſent a Commander named <hi>Vacis,</hi> to <hi>Porta Salaria,</hi> who reviled there the Romans for their diſloyalty to the <hi>Goths,</hi> and thus betraying their countrey, and indeed themſelves, having exchanged the Goths power, for Greeks, unable to defend them; none of which nation were formerly ſeen in <hi>Italy,</hi> but ſtage-players, and ſome pilfring mariners. But ſeeing none would anſwer him, he went back to <hi>Vitigis.</hi> The Romans alſo flouted <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> who had ſo hardly eſcaped, yet bade them deſpiſe theſe <hi>Barbarians;</hi> for he knew he ſhould abſolutely beat them. By what he knew this, ſhal be ſayd anon; but now it being grown late, and he being yet faſting, his wife and freinds had much ado to perſwade him to eat ſomething.</p>

                  <hi>Porta Aurelia</hi> (now named of <hi>Peter,</hi> the cheife of <hi>Chriſts Apoſtles,</hi> lying buried neer unto it) and the Gate beyond the <hi>Tiber.</hi> Thus they incompaſſed half the city; and being not cut off by the River, made the warre in what part of it they pleaſed. The <hi>Romans</hi> have built their walls on both ſides the River, thus. The <hi>Tiber</hi> grown great, runnes a good ſpace by the walls on this ſide of it, which ſtand by the Rivers ſide, upon Ground flat, and very aſſaultable. Oppoſite to them beyond the <hi>Tiber,</hi> is a * great hill, where ſtand the City mills; the water being brought by an <hi>Aquaeduct</hi> to the hill top, and from thence deſcending with much ſwiftneſſe: which cauſed the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> to compaſſe this hill, and the Rivers banck neer it with a wall; that an Enemy might not demoliſh the mills, nor paſſe the River to aſſail the town walls; which with a bridge they joyned to this part; and building houſes upon this ground beyond the <hi>Tiber,</hi> took the River into the midſt of the City. The <hi>Goths</hi> alſo made deep ditches about their intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and caſting the Earth inward, and therewith making the intrenchment very high, and pitching the top with multitude of ſtakes, they made their camps not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to ſo many Caſtles. The Entrenchment in <hi>Nero's</hi> feilds <hi>Marcias</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, being come out of <hi>Gaule</hi> with his troops, and there quartered. The other were commanded by <hi>Vitigis,</hi> and five other; a Commander to every intrenchment. They cut alſo all the <hi>Aquaeducts,</hi> to cut off the cities water that way: they are fourteen in all, ancient works of brick; and ſo deep and broad, that a man on Horſe back may ride in them. But <hi>Beliſarius</hi> to guard the City uſed this order; himſelf had <hi>Porta Pincia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and <hi>Porta Salaria</hi> ſtanding to the right hand of it, becauſe the wall there is very aſſaultable; and being oppoſite to the Enemy, the <hi>Romans</hi> were to ſally there. He gave <hi>Porta Praeneſtina</hi> to <hi>Beſſas,</hi> and to <hi>Conſtantianus Porta Flaminia</hi> (which ſtands to the left hand of <hi>Pinciana</hi>) and rammed up the gate with ſtones within, that it might not be opened; fearing the Enemies deſigns there, being cloſe to one of their Entrenchments. The other gates he directed the commanders of the foot to guard. The <hi>Aquaeducts</hi> he fortified a good ſpace, to avoyd miſcheife that way from without. But the <hi>Aquaeducts</hi> being cut, they wanted water for their mills, and with beaſts they could not worke, their ſcarce proviſions of fodder (as in a ſiege) not ſufficing for their horſes of ſervice. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> to help this, tied cables before the bridge, that joyned to the City wall, from one banck of the river to the other, ſtretching them ſtiff, and faſtning boats to them two foot aſunder, where the ſtream from the arches
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50471:87"/>of the bridge ranne ſtrongeſt; and putting into each boat a mill-ſtone, he hung the Engine between the boats which turns the Mill. Beneath theſe he tied other boats together in the ſame manner in a diſtance proportionable, fitting them with like En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines; and the ſtream being ſtrong, and turning the Engins, ſet the Mill ſtones on worke, and grinded ſufficient for the City. The Enemies informed hereof by fugitives, endeavored to ſpoil the Engins by throwing into the River great trees and bodies of <hi>Romans</hi> ſlain, and theſe being driven down with the ſtream, brake the Engins at firſt; but <hi>Beliſarius</hi> had this remedy. He hung before the bridge iron chains a-croſs the River, which ſtopt all that came down the ſtream; which men appointed drew up to the land; and this he did not only for the mills, but to prevent the Enemies entrance with boats through the bridge into the midſt of the City. The Barbarians failing in their attempt gave it over, and the Romans made uſe of thoſe mills, but for want of water were ſhut from their Baths; they had ſufficient to drinke, thoſe who dwelt far from the River having the commodity of wells. Their common ſew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers they needed not ſecure, having all their mouthes into the River; and ſo impoſſible to be entred by the Enemy.</p>
               <p>In the mean time among the <hi>Samnites,</hi> their boyes who kept their ſheep, chuſing two of the luſtieſt, and calling one <hi>Beliſarius</hi> and the other <hi>Vitigis,</hi> cauſed them to wreſtle. It was <hi>

               <p>BUT the people of <hi>Rome</hi> not uſed to the miſeries of warr, and a ſiege; and now wanting their baths, and pincht with ſcarcity, being put alſo to guard the walls, and want their ſleepes; ſuppoſing too, that ere long their City would be taken, and ſeeing already their country farmes ſpoiled by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy; they murmured greivouſly to be beſieged and run this hazard, having done no offence. So aſſembling themſelves, they railed at <hi>Beliſarius</hi> for preſuming to make war with the Goths, having no competent forces from the Emperour, and the Senators privatly objected the ſame unto him. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>itigis</hi> underſtanding this from fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitives, to exaſperate them yet more, and ſo to put the <hi>Romans</hi> affaires into confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he ſent Ambaſſadors to <hi>Beliſarius;</hi> among whom was one <hi>Albes,</hi> who having acceſſe to him in the preſence of the Senate, and Commanders of the army, ſpake <q>thus. Anciently, O Generall! men fitly defining names for things, have diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht preſumption from valour; the one drives men into danger with diſhonour, the other with virtue brings abundantly glory. One of theſe hath brought you hither, and which of them you may quickly manifeſt. If in the confidence of your valour you have entred into this warr; you ſee from your walls your Enemies; and brave S<hi rend="sup">•</hi>. you have meanes to be valiant enough. If through preſumption you have invaded us, you will certainly repent what you have raſhly done, as over-weening men ever uſe when they come to the tryall: Adde not therefore more miſery to theſe <hi>Romans,</hi> whom <hi>Theodorick</hi> hath bred in freedom and delights; and oppoſe not your ſelf againſt the Lord of the Goths and Italians. How abſurd is it for you, ſhut up thus, and affraid of your Enemies, to lodge in <hi>Rome,</hi> while her King lives in a trench, acting the miſcheifes of a war upon his own Subjects? Yet will wee grant to you and your troopes a free retreat, and leave to carry away your goods; holding it not religious nor manly to inſult upon men, who have learnt to be ſober again. But we would willingly aske theſe Romans wherewith they can charge the Goths, that they thus have betrayed both us and themſelves; having hitherto enjoyed our moderation, and now finding what your aides are.</q> 
                  <hi>Beliſarius</hi> to this ſpeech made this anſwer. Our ſeaſon for fighting ſhall not be at <q>your diſpoſing; men uſe not to make war by the adviſe of their Enemies, whoſe Law is for every man to order his owne buſineſſe to his owne liking: The time
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50471:88"/>will come when you would hide your heads in buſhes, and ſhall not be able. We having taken <hi>Rome,</hi> poſſeſſe nothing that is anothers. You uſurped it formerly being not yours, and now have reſtored it to the ancient owners. And who ever of you hopes to enter <hi>Rome</hi> without fighting, he is miſtaken. It is impoſſible <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſarius</hi> ſhould live, and ſo much degenerate.</q> Thus ſpake <hi>Beliſarius.</hi> But the <hi>Romans</hi> for fear ſate mute, not daring to contradict the Ambaſſadors, though re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached thus with treaſon. Onely <hi>Fidelius</hi> was bold to reprove them, being Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the pallace made by <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> and moſt affected to the Emperours Service. The Ambaſſadors were reconducted to the campe; whom <hi>Vitigis</hi> askt what manner of man <hi>Beliſarius</hi> was, and how reſolving, touching his retreat. They anſwered, that the <hi>Goths</hi> hoped an impoſſibility, if they thought to fright <hi>Beliſarius:</hi> whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Vitigis</hi> reſolved to aſſault the City; for which he was thus prepared. He made Towers of wood equall with the walls; having the juſt meaſure of them by often numbring the ſtones: at the Baſes and corners of the towers were wheeles, which with eaſe were moved and turned about as the aſſailants pleaſed, and drawn by ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en. He fitted alſo many Ladders, and made four Rammes; which Engin is made firſt ſetting up four woodden pillars equall and oppoſite to each other; into which are morteſſed eight croſſe beams, four above and four into the Baſes, making the form of a little houſe four ſquare. This inſtead of roofe and walls was covered with Skins, that it might be light to draw, and they within ſecure from ſhot. Within a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Engin aloft, hangs another croſſe beam with looſe chains, the top where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is made ſharpe, and over it a great quantity of iron layd as on the head end of an arrow, where the ſaid iron is made four ſquare like an anvill. The Engin is rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon four wheeles, faſtned to the four pillars; and within fifty men at leaſt move it, who having ſet it to the walls, draw the ſaid looſe beam backward with a pully, then let it go with violence at the walls; and by often ſhooting it thus, it ſhakes and makes a breach where it hits: hence the Engin hath the name; the point of the ſaid beam putting forth, and puſhing like a ram. The <hi>Goths</hi> alſo had quantity of fagots of wood and reed ready, to make the ground and the City ditch even for their Engins to paſſe without rubb. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> upon the other ſide placed upon the Towers engins called <hi>Baliſtae.</hi> Theſe have the form of a bow, with a hollow horne ſticking out beneath and hanging looſe, but lying upon a ſtrait peice of Iron: when they are to ſhoote, they bend the two peices of wood, making the two ends of the bow, with cord; and put the arrow upon the hollow horne, being halfe ſo long as common arrowes, and four times as thick. It mounts not with feathers, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead thereof hath thinn peices of wood morteſs'd in, and it is in ſhape wholly like common arrowes, having a head of iron proportionable to its thickneſſe; men at both ends bend the bow with pullyes; and the hollow horne going forward, at laſt falls off, and out flies the arrow with ſuch force, that it reaches twice as far as an arrow from a bow, and lighting upon tree or ſtone, cleaves it aſunder. It is called <hi>Baliſtae,</hi> becauſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>it ſhootes very far. Other Engins were ſet upon the battlements proper for ſlinging ſtones, and are like ſlings, and are called wild Aſſes. At the Gates they ſet up wolves,<note place="margin">Theſe wolves were ſomething like <hi>Potteuliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi>
                  </note> made thus. They ſet two beams from the ground reaching to the battlements; and laying Chequer wiſe peices of Timber wrought, ſome upright and ſome a croſſe, they joynt them ſo, that the morteſſing holes meete one another. And before each joynt ſticks out a pointed peice of wood like a thick ſpurr and faſtning the croſſe timbers to another beam, which from the top reaches half way down, they lay the beams flat-long upon the Gates, &amp; an Enemy approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, men above lay hold of the higher ends of the beams and thruſt them down, which falling ſuddenly among the Aſſailants with thoſe wooden points ſticking out, kill all they light on. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> having theſe preparations, the Goths conducted by <hi>Vitigis</hi> himſelf the eighteenth day of the ſiege about ſun riſing, marcht to the aſſault. The Towers and Rams in the head of them aſtoniſht the <hi>Romans,</hi> not uſed to ſuch ſights. But <hi>Beliſarius</hi> ſeeing the Enemies order with their Engins, fell into a laughing, and bade the Souldiers ſtand and begin no fight, till he gave the Signall. He imparted not the reaſon of his laughing, but afterward it was known. The Romans thinking he jeer'd them, railed at him, and called him an impudent man, and extreamly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured, that he did not ſtop the Enemy coming neer or ſtill. Who being approacht the town ditch, the Generall bent his bow and ſhot an armed man, leading the reſt
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50471:88"/>into the neck; and the wound being mortall, the man fell downe with his face up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. All the people of <hi>Rome</hi> upon the Battlements taking it for an excellent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, made a huge ſhout. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> ſhot again, with the like fortune, and againe there was a greater ſhout from the walls, that the <hi>Romans</hi> within thought the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy had been vanquiſht. Then <hi>Beliſarius</hi> gave the ſignall to the whole Army to ſhoot, and commanded thoſe about himſelfe, to employ all their Arrows againſt the Oxen; which ſoone fell all, and ſo the Enemy could neither bring on their Towers, nor invent any remedy, being puzzel'd in the midſt of their buſineſs. Then was known <hi>Beliſarius</hi> providence, not to ſtop them afar off; and that he laughed at their ſottiſhneſſe, in hoping to bring their Oxen to their Enemies walls ſo unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly. Theſe things were about <hi>Porta Beliſaria.</hi>

               <p>BUT <hi>Vitigis</hi> being there repulſed, left a good part of the Army, ordered in a deep Batallion; and directing the Commanders, not to aſſaile the walls, but to ſtand in their orders, and ply the Battlements with ſhot, to divert <hi>Beliſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> from ſuccouring another part (which with greater Forces hee meant to aſſault) he marched toward <hi>Porta Praeneſtina,</hi> to that part which is called <hi>Vivari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> (or the Park) where the Walls are moſt aſſaultable, having other Engines of Rammes, Towers, and ſcaling Ladders. The <hi>Goths</hi> alſo made another aſſault a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Porta Aurelia;</hi> without which ſtands <hi>Adrians</hi> Tomb, a ſtones caſt from the wals, worth the ſight. It is made of <hi>Parian</hi> ſtone cloſe joyned, without any other matter within. It hath four equall ſquares, each being neer a ſtones caſt broad, and is higher then the City walls. On the top are Statues of the ſame ſtone of men and horſes, of admirable worke. This tombe the Citizens have anciently joyned to the walls by two Flanckers from the ſame; that it ſhews as a turret defending the gate there. The Fortification being very ſufficient, <hi>Beliſarius</hi> gave the command of it to <hi>Conſtantianus,</hi> directing him to take care of the wall adjoyning, which had but a ſmall guard. For the wall being there ſtrong (the river running under it, he look't not for an aſſault that way, and ſo put no important guard at it; diſtributing his maine Forces (which were but few) to the moſt neceſſary places. For the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Army at the beginning of this ſiege amounted but to five thouſand men in <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conſtantianus</hi> perceiving the Enemy to attempt a paſſage over the <hi>Tiber,</hi> and fearing the Flancker there, himſelfe went to the ſuccour with a few, directing the reſt to guard the Gate and <hi>Adrians</hi> tomb. Where the <hi>Goths</hi> gave on, holding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them their leather Bucklers like <hi>Perſian</hi> Targets, and having no engines of Batteries, but ſtore of ſcaling Ladders and Archery, thinking quickly to perplex the Enemy, and maſter the Garriſon being few. Their oppoſites ſaw them not, till they came very neer, being covered by the <hi>Porticus,</hi> which reaches to Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Church. Then ſuddenly the <hi>Goths</hi> ſhewing themſelves, began; and the <hi>Romans</hi> were not able to uſe their <hi>Baliſtas</hi> (which can ſhoot but right forward) nor with their Archery to annoy them, the ſhot doing no good by reaſon of thoſe Bucklers. The <hi>Goths</hi> preſt hard, and ſhot thick at the Battlements, and were ready to ſe their Ladders to the Flanckers, having almoſt encompaſſed the tomb, and when the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> came on, ſtill wheeling about at their backs. The <hi>Romans</hi> were troubled, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no hope of holding out, till they agreed to take down the Statues being great, and the ſtones huge, which they threw down upon the Enemies heads. Who being hurt, gave ground by little and little, and the <hi>Romans</hi> grew bold, and repelled them with their Bowes and ſtones; and falling to their Engines, put them into feare, ſo that their aſſault was not long. And <hi>Conſtantianus</hi> appearing, frighted thoſe who attempted to paſſe the River, not finding the Flancker there without guard, as they imagined.</p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>Aurelian</hi> gate was in ſafety, and all about it. The Enemy alſo attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Porta Pancratiana</hi> upon the River, but did no good upon the place, being ſtrong,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50471:89"/>and the walls not eaſily aſſaultable there, ſtanding on ſteep ground. <hi>Paulus</hi> with his Foot company guarded there. Neither attempted they <hi>Porta Flaminia,</hi> ſcituate upon craggy ground, not eaſie of acceſſe, and guarded by a Foot-company of <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians,</hi> commanded by <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſicinus.</hi> Between this gate and <hi>Porta Pinciana,</hi> next it on the right hand, part of the wall had been long broken halfe way down from the top. It fell not, but panch't on both ſides, part appearing inward, and part outward: whence the <hi>Romans</hi> call it the broken wall. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> at his firſt coming, going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to repair it, the <hi>Romans</hi> hindered him, alleadging that the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> had promiſed to guard the place, whom above all they reverence. And it ſucceeded ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their expectation: For neither that day, nor during all the ſiege of <hi>Rome</hi> the Enemy ever approacht it, not was the leaſt trouble about it. And we wondered in all the time, that the place never came into the Enemies thoughts, having made ſo many aſſaults, and attempts by night. No man ſince hath been ſo bold as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire it, but ſtill the wall remains broken. At <hi>Porta Salaria</hi> in the meane time, a tall goodly man, valiant, and of good quality among the <hi>Goths,</hi> being armed with Corſlet and Morion, left his ranke; and ſtanding on a tree, threw a rope up to the Battlements, whom an arrow from a <hi>Baliſta</hi> piercing through his body halfe way into the tree, nailed him dead to the ſame. This frighted the <hi>Goths</hi> from coming within arrow-ſhot, and kept them in their ranks, from infeſting any more thoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the walls.</p>

Anciently the <hi>Romans</hi> finding the ground flat, and fit for invaſion, and the bricks of the wall there grown looſe, ſcarce ſticking toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, compaſſed the ſame with a Flancker, not ſo much for ſafety (for it had no Battlements, nor other Fortification upon it, to reſiſt an Enemy) but for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to keep in it Lions, and other wild Beaſts, whereupon it was named <hi>Vivari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> the Park. <hi>Vitigis</hi> made ready his Engines againſt the wall there, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Goths</hi> to get through the Flancker into the Park, and then he knew he ſhould be eaſily maſter of the Town-walls, being weake. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> ſeeing the Enemy dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging through into the Park, and in many parts aſſaulting the walls, ſuffered not his men to defend, nor ſtay upon the Battlements, but held them, with their ſwords and Armour ready neer unto the Gate there. The <hi>Goths</hi> having now cut through the wall, and entred the Park, he ſent out <hi>Cyprianus</hi> with his company to begin the fight; who killed them all, falling downe for feare, and ſpoiled by one another, running out at their narrow breach: the whole Enemy being amazed with the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denneſſe, and out of their orders, and ſome carried one way, ſome another. <hi>Beliſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> inſtantly opened the Gate, and ſallied with the whole Army; And the <hi>Goths</hi> having no mind to fight, ranne away every man; whom the <hi>Romans</hi> followed, and killed them with eaſe, and had a long execution; the <hi>Goths</hi> having aſſaulted there far from their Entrenchments. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> commanded to burn the Enemies Engines, which with the flame (being high) more aſtoniſhed them. At <hi>Porta Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laria</hi> alſo they ſallied at the ſame time unexpectedly, killed the Enemy running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way without reſiſtance, and burnt their Engines.

               <p>
                  <q>We are come into <hi>Italy,</hi> according to your commands, and have gained a great part of the Country, and taken <hi>Rome,</hi> expelling the <hi>Goths,</hi> whoſe Commander <hi>Leuderis</hi> we ſend.<note place="margin">Beliſarius <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended</hi> Rome <hi>with</hi> 5000 <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt</hi> 150000. Goths.</note> But in the ſtrong places of <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> (which we took by ſiege) we have left the greateſt part of our Armie; that it is now reduced to 5000 men, the Enemie aſſailing us with 150000. Firſt, going out to diſcover the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my neer the <hi>Tiber,</hi> we were put to fight beyond our determination, and were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt overwhelmed with the multitude of their Lances. Afterward they made a generall aſſault with men and Engines on all ſides, and failed little of taking <hi>Rome</hi> at the firſt aſſault, if fortune had not reſcued us. Hitherto what hath been done by fortune, or valour, hath ſucceeded well: But now I muſt entreat, what may conduce to your future ſervice. I will never conceale what it behoves me to ſay, and you to do. I know affaires goe as God guides them, but the Governours of them get blame or commendation by the actions they perform. So that Armes muſt be ſent us, and ſuch numbers of Men, as that we may encounter the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with aequivalent powers. We muſt not ever truſt to fortune, which runs not always one way. And conſider, O Emperour! That if the <hi>Goths</hi> now beat us, we ſhall looſe <hi>Italy</hi> (now yours) and our Army too; beſides the diſgrace for our ill carriage of the buſineſſe. And we ſhall alſo undoe the <hi>Romans,</hi> who have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred their faith to your Empire before their ſafety; and ſo will our proſperity prove the occaſion of our calamity. For if we had been repulſed from <hi>Italy,</hi> or before from <hi>Sicily,</hi> the lighteſt of misfortunes would have troubled us only; not to be rich with other mens goods. You are to conſider alſo, that <hi>Rome</hi> was never before kept ſo long, with many thouſands; it compaſſes ſo much ground: and being not upon the Sea, it is excluded from neceſſaries. The <hi>Romans</hi> yet are well affected to us, but the prolongation of their miſeries will make them chooſe the beſt for themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> New freinds to any men, keep faith, not when they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, but when they proſper by them. Beſides, the <hi>Romans</hi> will by famine be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to do things they would not. I know I owe my death to your Majeſty, ſo that none ſhall ever pull me out of this place alive; But think, what glory ſuch a death of <hi>Beliſarius</hi> will bring you.</q>

               <p>The Emperour upon this letter gathered an Army and Ships, and ſent direction to <hi>Valerianus,</hi> and <hi>Martinus,</hi> who were diſpatch'd with an Army about the Winter Solſtice, to ſaile for <hi>Italy</hi> with all ſpeed; but not able to keep the Sea further, went on Land, and wintred in <hi>Aetolia,</hi> and <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>In the mean time in <hi>Naples</hi> this happened. The Image of <hi>Theodorick,</hi> King of the <hi>Goths</hi> ſtood in the Market-place, made of ſmall peeble ſtones, dyed into all colours. In his life time the ſtones of the head of this Image peeled and ſhed off, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after he dyed: Eight years after, the peebles forming the Images belly dropt off, and inſtantly <hi>Atalarick</hi> dyed, <hi>Theodoricks</hi> daughters ſon: ſoon after fell off the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles upon the privities, and then his daughter <hi>Amalaſuntha</hi> was murthered. And now the <hi>Goths</hi> beſieging <hi>Rome,</hi> the limbs down to the Images feet were in the ſame manner ſpoiled, and the whole out-ſide defaced; and the <hi>Romans</hi> divining upon it, were confident of the Emperours prevailing in this Warr; taking <hi>Theodoricks</hi> feete for his Subjects, the people of the <hi>Goths.</hi> In <hi>Rome</hi> alſo ſome <hi>Patricians</hi> produced O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of <hi>Sibylla,</hi> that the Cities danger would laſt but till <hi>July;</hi> when the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould have a King, through whom they ſhould no more feare <hi>Geticke</hi> Nations: And the <hi>Goths,</hi> they ſay, are a Nation of <hi>Getes.</hi> In the Oracle it is the fifth moneth, which they interpreted <hi>July;</hi> ſome, becauſe the ſiege began in the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> from which <hi>July</hi> is the fifth; others, becauſe before <hi>Numa</hi> March was the firſt moneth, there being but ten in all, whence <hi>July</hi> was called <hi>Quintilis.</hi> But this was miſtaken all. For the <hi>Romans</hi> had no ſuch King, and the ſiege was raiſed after that time, and another ſiege was under <hi>Totilas</hi> King of the <hi>Goths,</hi> as ſhall be ſaid hereafter. I conceive the Propheſie to intend not this, but ſome other invaſion of <hi>Barbarians,</hi> happened already, or to come: And to find the meaning of <hi>Sibylla's</hi> Oracles before the event, is not poſſible, for a cauſe I ſhall tell you, having read them all over. <hi>Sibylla</hi> utters not things in order, nor with any congruity.

               <p>THE <hi>Goths</hi> were thus repulſed, and both parts paſt that night as I have ſayd. The next day <hi>Beliſarius</hi> commanded the <hi>Romans</hi> to ſend away their Wives and Children to <hi>Naples,</hi> and ſuch ſervants as were not uſefull for defence of the City, to ſave victuals; and he willed the Souldiers to ſend away their women ſervants, telling them he ſhould not be able to feed ſuch, but muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to put themſelves to half victuals every day, &amp; to take the remainder of their entertainments in money. They did ſo, and multitudes went into <hi>Campania,</hi> ſome getting ſhipping at the Port of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the reſt going by <hi>Via Appia</hi> by Land. And neither that way, nor to the Port feared they danger; the Enemie being not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to encompaſſe <hi>Rome</hi> with their Entrenchments, nor daring in ſmall parties to be far from their Camp, for feare of the <hi>Romans</hi> excurſions: That the beſieged had meanes enough for a time to remove out of the Citie, and to bring in proviſions, eſpecially by night. For the <hi>Goths</hi> were affraid, and attending their Guards, kept in; and the <hi>Moores</hi> often ſallyed, and finding them either aſleep, or in ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies upon the wayes to paſture their Cattell, or to get neceſſaries for themſelves (as is uſuall in great Armes) they killed and ſtript them; and if they ſaw numbers of Enemies charging them, they ran home, being naturally ſwift of foot, lightly apparelled, and beginning to fly in time. Thus the uſeleſſe multititude got away out of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſome into <hi>Campania,</hi> ſome into <hi>Sicily,</hi> or whether they could with moſt eaſe.</p>
               <p>But the Souldiers being few, and not ſufficient for ſo great a circuit of wall, and ſome being to take their reſt, while others guarded; and the common people being poor handi-crafts men, having nothing but from one day to another, and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no means to releive them; <hi>Beliſarius</hi> mingled them with the Souldiers upon the Guards, and appointed them them a daily pay, raiſing <hi>Companies</hi> of them, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent to guard the Citie; and to every company allotting their nights, ſo that all in their turnes ſtood Sentinells. And by this meanes the Souldiers were releived, and they fed.</p>
               <p>Having ſome ſuſpition that <hi>Liberius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> practiſed to betray the Citie to the <hi>Goths,</hi> he ſent him into <hi>Greece,</hi> and made <hi>Vigilius</hi> Biſhop ſoone after. Upon the ſame ground he baniſhed ſome Senators, whom he recalled after the ſiege was raiſed, and the <hi>Goths</hi> retired. One of theſe was <hi>Maximus,</hi> whoſe Grand-father. <hi>Maximus</hi> ruined the Emperour <hi>Valentinian.</hi> Fearing deſigns upon the Gates, and leſt ſome might be corrupted with money, he brake the old keyes twice a moneth, and made new of the ſame form. And he ſtil changed the Sentinels to other Guards far off; and every night appointed new Commanders of thoſe Guards, who were directed every night by turns to goe rounds, with notes in writing of the Sentinels names, and where any was miſſing, to place new in his roome, and the next day to produce the defaulters for due puniſhment to be inflicted. And he commanded Muſitians to play all night on their Inſtruments upon the walls. He ſent out <hi>Moores</hi> alſo with dogs to lye all night about the ditch, to diſcover ſuch as came towards the walls though afar off.</p>
               <p>Some <hi>Romans</hi> then attempted ſecretly to force open the gates of <hi>Janus.</hi> This was the chiefe of thoſe ancient gods, whom the <hi>Romans</hi> called <hi>Penates.</hi> His Temple is in the <hi>Forum,</hi> before the Senate houſe, a little beyond the Temple of the three <hi>Fates.</hi> It is all of Braſſe, four-ſquare, high enough only to cover the Image, which is of braſſe alſo, five cubits high, reſembling a man, only it hath two faces, one ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Eaſt, and the other to the Weſt, and againſt each face are brazen gates,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50471:90"/>which the Romans anciently kept ſhut in Peace and Proſperity, and in time of War ſet them open. But ſince the Romans have imbraced Chriſtian Religion, as much as any men whatſoever, they opened theſe Gates no more, though they were in Wars. But in this Seige, ſome having the old Religion (I think) in their mindes, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured ſecretly to open them, but could not wholly, but onely ſo much, as they ſtood not cloſe together as before. The Actors were not knowne, nor inquired after in that troubleſome time; none of the Magiſtrates, and few of the People having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it <hi>Vitigis</hi> in the meane time being in Rage, and troubled, ſent ſome of his Lanciers to <hi>Ravenna</hi> to kill the Roman Senators, whom in the beginning of the War he had brought thither.

                  <hi>VItigis</hi> alſo ſeeing the Enemies free ſcope of exporting from the City what they pleaſed, and of importing Proviſions by Sea and Land; reſolved to take in <hi>Portus,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> Haven, ſtanding almoſt 13. miles from the City, (ſo far is <hi>Rome</hi> diſtant from the Sea:) and being at the mouth of the <hi>Tiber,</hi> which coming from <hi>Rome,</hi> and being almoſt within two miles of the Sea, parts in two, and makes the <hi>Holy Iſland.</hi> This Iſland growes ſtill broader downe the River, and for about two miles together is as broad as long, and on both ſides of it the <hi>Tiber</hi> is navigable in two ſeverall Streames. The right-hand Stream runs into the Haven; where without the Rivers mouth upon the Strand is an ancient City called <hi>Portus,</hi> incompaſſed with a ſtrong Wall on the left hand. At the other Streames mouth beyond the ſhore of the <hi>Tiber</hi> ſtands <hi>Oſtia,</hi> anciently a famous City, but now without Walls. The way from <hi>Portus</hi> to the City the <hi>Romans</hi> have made paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable; and ſtill Lighters are in readineſſe in the Haven, and many Oxen for Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants to draw up their Goods to <hi>Rome</hi> aboard thoſe Lighters not uſing Sailes, no wind being able to ſtemme them up the Stream, by reaſon of the many eddies in the River: And Oares can do no good, the Stream againſt them is ſo ſtrong; ſo that they tye the Lighters with long Ropes to the Oxen, and draw them up to <hi>Rome</hi> like Waggons. The way to <hi>Rome</hi> on the other ſide the <hi>Tiber</hi> is woody and neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and not neere the ſhore; the Lighters being never drawn that way. The <hi>Goths</hi> finding the ſaid Towne of <hi>Portus</hi> ungaurded, took it at the firſt on-ſet, and killed many Romans dwelling in it, and ſo held the Haven too; leaving a Garriſon of a 1000. men, and the reſt retiring to their Campe. So that nothing could come to <hi>Rome</hi> from the Sea, but by <hi>Oſtia</hi> with much toile and danger; the Romans Ships coming no more in at <hi>Portus,</hi> but lying at <hi>Antium,</hi> a daies journey from <hi>Oſtia,</hi> and from thence bringing their Commodities. Scarcety of men cauſed this: For <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſarius</hi> ſearing <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelfe, could put none into <hi>Portus;</hi> if there had been but 300. men in it, the <hi>Goths</hi> had never attempted it, being a ſtrong Place; and this they did the third day after their being beaten from the Aſſault. Twenty daies after the taking of <hi>Portus,</hi> and the Haven, came <hi>Martinus</hi> and <hi>Valerianus</hi> with 1600. Horſe-men, moſt <hi>Hunnes, Slavonians,</hi> and <hi>Antians,</hi> ſeated beyond the River <hi>Jole</hi> not far from it. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> glad of their company, reſolved now to make the War upon the Enemy; and the next day commanded <hi>Traianus,</hi> one of his Life-guard, a valiant man, to march with 200. of his Targetiers on Horſeback againſt the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians,</hi> and neere their Entrenchments to get up to a Hill which he ſhewed them, and there to ſtand; if the Enemy came againſt them, not to come to the Sword, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Having thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, he prepared the ſhooting Engines, and their Engineers. <hi>Traianus</hi> at <hi>Porta Salaria</hi> ſallied out upon the Enemies Campe; who amazed with the ſuddaineſſe, encountred, as every man chanced to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e in readineſſe. <hi>Traianus,</hi> got up to the Hill, kept off the <hi>Goths</hi> with his ſhot, which falling among a multitude, ſtill hit Man, or Horſe; and their Arrowes being ſpent, they gallopt home with the <hi>Goths</hi> at
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50471:91"/>their heeles: who being neere the Walls, the Engineers fell to work with their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, and then the <hi>Goths</hi> gave over the Chaſe. In this Action were kill'd a 1000. <hi>Goths.</hi> Some few daies after <hi>Beliſarius</hi> ſent out <hi>Mundilas,</hi> one of his Guard, his Favourite, and <hi>Diogenes,</hi> extraordinary good Souldiers, with. 300. of his Target<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, to do the like, and they did ſo; and killed rather more of the Enemy, then fell before, and in the ſame manner. The third time he ſent out <hi>Oilas,</hi> one of his Life-guard, who performed upon the Enemy the ſame things; So that with theſe three Sallies he killed about 4000. Enemies. <hi>Vitigis</hi> (who conceaved not the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between training men to their Armes in Camps, and an experimentall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectneſſe in the Actions of War) though by charging alſo with ſmall Forces to indamage the Enemy. And ſo he ſent 500. Horſe to approach the Walls, and what they had ſuffered from a few, to act upon the Enemies whole Army. Theſe got to a riſing ground neere the City, onely out of Arrow ſhot, and there ſtood. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> commanded <hi>Beſſas</hi> with a 1000. ſelected men to charge them: Theſe made a compaſſe, and ſhooting the Enemies backs, killed many, and forced the reſt to come downe to the plaine ground, where the Fight being with Sword and Lance, and with unequall powers, the <hi>Goths</hi> were moſt cut in peices, and the reſt retired with difficulty to their Campe; whom <hi>Vitigis</hi> reviled, as beaten through want of Valour. Three daies after he ſent out 500. ſelected out of all the Quarters, and bad them do as became their Valour and Reputation. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> ſeeing them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, ſent againſt them <hi>Martinus</hi> and <hi>Valerianns</hi> with their 1500.

               <p>BUT the Romans extolled <hi>Beliſarius</hi> for his Wiſdome; admiring him, as they had reaſon. One of his Favourites askt him, what Argument he ſaw that day wherein he eſcaped the Enemy, to be ſo full of the hope of Victory. He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that beginning to fight with them with a few in his Company, he found the difference of either Army, ſuch as if he make his Fights proportionable to his Powers, the Enemies multitude ſhall not ruine his ſmall numbers. The difference was, that the Romans almoſt all, and the auxiliary <hi>Hunnes</hi> were Archers on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back; a matter not practiſed by the Goths, whoſe Horſe-men have only Lances and Swords, and all their Archers fight on foot, covered with their armed men; ſo that the Horſe-men, unleſſe the Fight be at handy blowes, having nothing to reſiſt with, are eaſily ſhot and ruined by the Enemy, uſing Bowes; and their Foot cannot make excurſions againſt Horſe. Theſe he alleadged to be the reaſons of their being beaten in the former Encounters. But the Goths finding how ſtrangly things fell out, would no more ride up to the Walls in ſmall Parties, nor purſue the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my infeſting, but ſo much only as to drive them from their Trenches. The Romans exalted with theſe Proſperities, longed to come to a generall Battell, and would have the War made in an open brave way: but <hi>Beliſarius</hi> ſeeing the great odds againſt him, was fearfull to hazard his whole Army; at laſt wearied with the rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Army, and Roman Citizens, he reſolved to give Battell; but to begin with Excurſions. Often he was repulſed attempting, and forced to put it off till the next day: But at laſt finding the Enemy advertiſed by Fugitives what would be, and beyond his Expectation in readineſſe, he determined to fight in the open way, which the Goths gladly entertained; And both Parties being Imbattelled, <q>
                     <hi>Beliſarius</hi> made this Speech to his Army. Fellow Souldiers, I have been backward to come to a Battell with the Enemy, not condemning you of faintneſſe, nor fearing their Powers; but becauſe in this way of Excurſions we have proſpered, and I thought it beſt to ply the cauſe of our proſpering; holding it inconvenient, for men ſetled in a courſe to their mind, to be altered by others.</q> But ſeeing now your forwardneſſe to hazard, I hope well, and will be no further a ſtop to your Courage; knowing that in War, the Reſolutions of thoſe that fight, contribute
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50471:91"/>
                  <q>the greateſt part of the Succeſſe, and that moſt things are acted by their Alacrity. And your ſelves know, not by heare-ſay, but by your daily experience, that few, well ordered with Valour, can conquer multitudes. It is now in your power not to blemiſh the glory of my former Stratagems, nor my hope in this your Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity. All we have acted in this War, muſt be judged by the Succeſſe of this day. The preſent opportunity is for us, and in likely-hood will ſubdue the Enemy to us, their Courage being dejected by what is paſt; and the Reſolutions of men often unfortunate, ſeldome performing valiantly. Let none therefore ſpare his Horſe, or Bow;</q> what is ſpoiled in Fight, ſhall inſtantly be ſupplied by me. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſarius</hi> having thus ſaid, led out the Army at <hi>Porta Pinciana,</hi> and <hi>Salaria. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinus</hi> a Captain of Horſe, he ſent out at <hi>Porta Aurelia</hi> to <hi>Nero's</hi> Feilds, with not many; whom he directed not to begin any Fight, nor to approach the Enemies Campe, but ſtill to make countenance of charging, thereby to keep the Enemy there from paſſing † the Bridge,<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pons Milvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> which ſtood ſomething diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant from the City.</note> to ſuccour the other Quarters. For he held it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to cut off thoſe in <hi>Nero's</hi> Feilds (being many) from ſuccouring the reſt of the Enemy. The Commons of <hi>Rome</hi> being Voluntaries, he would not mingle with the Souldiers in the Battell, fearing, leaſt being handicrafts men, unexperienced in War, they might upon apprehenſion of the danger diſorder the Army. So he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to ſtand in a Battallion without <hi>Porta Pancratiana</hi> beyond the <hi>Tiber,</hi> till he gave the Signall; imagining that which fell out, that the Enemy in <hi>Nero's</hi> Feilds (who were in great numbers) ſeeing them, and <hi>Valentinus</hi> Troopes, would not venter out of their quarter to joyne with the reſt of the Gothiſh Army; and to keep them divided, he took to be a matter of great Importance. He reſolved alſo that day to fight with Horſe onely; for moſt of the Foot having ſtolne Horſe from the Enemy, and being skilfull Riders, were turned Horſe-men. And ſo his Foot being few, not able to make a Batallion of any Importance, nor daring to fight, but in caſe to run away at the firſt charge, he thought it ſafeſt to place them not far from the City, and cauſed them to ſtand ſtill cloſe to the City Ditch, to receive the Horſe if they were beaten back, and being freſh, to help to reſiſt the Enemy. But <hi>Principius</hi> one of his Guard, a <hi>Piſidian,</hi> and an approved Souldier, and <hi>Tarmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> an <hi>Iſaurian,</hi> Brother to <hi>Ennes,</hi> Collonell of the <hi>Iſaurians,</hi> came to <hi>Beliſarius,</hi>
                  <q>and ſaid this. Excellent Generall, ſuffer not your ſmall Army encountring ſo many thouſands, to want your Battallion of Foot, nor put not a diſgrace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Roman Infantry, by which the Empire of the ancient Romans arrived to ſo much greatneſſe. If in this War they have done little Service, it is no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Cowardiſe, but their Commanders are to beare the blame, for ſerving on Horſe-back, and not eſteeming the Fortune of the War common to all, nay often running away before the Fight. Now you ſee our Foot Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders all Horſe-men, not contented to ſerve with thoſe under their Conduct; And keep them, Sr. with the other Horſe in this Battel, but ſuffer us to lead on the Foot; and we alighting on foot, will with them ſtand this multitude of <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> hoping to do ſomething, as God ſhall give us Grace.</q> 
                  <hi>Beliſarius</hi> at firſt would not grant this Motion, loving the men whom he knew valiant, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to put the Foot (being few) to the hazard; at laſt importuned with their forwardneſſe, he placed ſome few Foot at the Gates, and upon the Battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with the common People, and about the Engines; the reſt he commanded to ſtand in order behind him, under <hi>Principius,</hi> and <hi>Tarmutus,</hi> that they might not by apprehending danger, put the reſt of the Army in confuſion; and if any Horſe were routed, they might not run far, but flying to the Foot, with them reſiſt the Purſuers.</p>

                  <hi>VITIGIS</hi> alſo put the <hi>Goths</hi> in armes, not leaving any in the Trenches but unſerviceable men. The troopes under <hi>Marcias</hi> hee commanded to ſtand ſtill in <hi>Neros</hi> feilds attending the Guard of the bridge, that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy might not come that way; and aſſembling the Army he ſpake thus. <q>Some may thinke me fearfull of the loſſe of my Kingdome, and from thence grown kind, and to ſpeak now what may move you to courage: and it is no ſtrange conceit, for ill natur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d men uſe to be curteous to meaner people when they need them; and to be churliſh to thoſe whoſe ſervice they have no uſe of. For me; I care neither for loſſe of life, nor Kingdome: I could wiſh this day to put off this purple robe, if a Goth were to put it on; and I think the death of <hi>Theodatus</hi> to have been very happy, looſing his life and Government at once, by the hands of his own Nation: A private diſaſter, not ruining the whole race, is not without comfort to a wiſe man. When I conſider the miſeries of the <hi>Vandales,</hi> and the end of <hi>Gelimer,</hi> I can think nothing tollerable. Me thinks I ſee the Goths with their children made ſlaves, and their wives doing the baſeſt ſervices to their greateſt foes; and my ſelf, with this Daughter of <hi>Theodoricks</hi> daughter, led away whether it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes our Enemies I would have you with the fear of theſe things to enter into this fight; for ſo will you rather chuſe death upon the place, then ſafety after an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw. Generous men judge of miſ-fortunes by one rule only; namely to be vanquiſht by their Enemies: Beſides, a quick Death makes men happy before miſerable. And it is evident that theſe our choice men diſputing this battell will eaſily overcome the Enemy, (a few <hi>Greeks,</hi> or no better then <hi>Greeks</hi>) and chaſtiſe them for the wrongs and ſcorns they have done us. Certainly we hold our ſelves their betters in valour, numbers, and every thing; and their boldneſſe is grown out of our miſ-fortunes, nothing ſuſtains them but our negligence; it is their proſpering beyond their deſerts that feeds their confidence.</q> 
                  <hi>Vitigis</hi> having uſed this Exhortation, marſhalled his army. He placed his bataillion of foot between the wings of horſe very neer their intrenchments, that having routed the Enemy they might overtake them the better, and have the Execution in a great way of Ground. For by reaſon the Enemies army was much inferiour in powers, he hoped that the battell coming to Sword and Lance, they would not be able to ſtand them. They began on both ſides early in the morning, <hi>Vitigis</hi> and <hi>Beliſarius</hi> incouraging their men in their Reares. At firſt the Romans had the better, and the Goths fell thick by the ſhot: but there was no rout; the Goths with their great numbers ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ſupplying the ſlain, that the loſſe was not ſeen; and the <hi>Romans</hi> being few thought it enough to be at this point, to continue the fight up to the entrenchments, and having killed many to return to the city with the firſt faire pretence. In this Encounter three Romans did beſt; <hi>Athenodorus</hi> an <hi>Iſaurian,</hi> one of the life Guard to <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> of good reputation; and <hi>Theodoret</hi> and <hi>George, Cappadocians,</hi> and of the Life Guard to <hi>Martinus;</hi> who ſtill ſallied out of their bataillion, and kept off the Barbarians. In <hi>Nero's</hi> feilds both ſides ſtood ſtill a long time, onely the Moores made excurſions darting their Javelins, and infeſted the Goths, who would not charge them for fear of the common people, whom they tooke to be Souldiers; and to ſtand there with ſome deſign to get their backs and by ſhooting them both waies to ruine them. About noon ſuddenly the Romans there gave on, and routed the Goths amazed with the ſuddenneſſe who could not fly to their quarter, but got up to ſome hill and there ſtood. The Romans (though many) were moſt an unarmed multitude; many mariners and Servants being mingled with Souldiers, and the main army being elſe where; yet terrifying the Goths with their numbers they thus rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them; but by their diſorder undid themſelves. For the Souldiers being ſo ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led fell into confuſion, and were deaf to all the directions of <hi>Valentinus</hi> their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander; They not ſo much as followed the Enemy nor killed any, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ave them leave quietly upon the hills to view what they did. Neither came it into their minds
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50471:92"/>to cut the bridge which had excluded the Enemy from beyond the Tiber, and from beſieging <hi>Rome</hi> on both ſides: nor by paſſing the bridge, did they charge the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies backs fighting with <hi>Beliſarius</hi> Troops; which had put the Enemy to flight doubtleſſe without reſiſting any longer; but they turn'd to pillage the Enemies quarter, and carryed away much ſilver veſſell and other Goods. The <hi>Barbarians</hi> where they were, ſtood ſtill a while to ſee what they did. At laſt all together ſhouting, and with much fury they charged them; and finding them pillaging and in confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, they killed many, and drave away the reſt; who threw away their pillage and ran away. Whilſt this was doing in <hi>Nero's</hi> feilds, the other <hi>Goths</hi> neere their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters fencing with their ſheilds reſiſted the Enemy, and killed many men, and more horſes. The <hi>Romans</hi> ſome wounded, ſome having loſt their Horſes, left their rancks, and then in the army (ſmall before) the fewneſſe was more apparant, and their great diſproportion to the <hi>Goths</hi> multitude; which the Barbarian horſe perceiving, from the left wing gallopt toward the Enemy next them. They not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding the <hi>Goths</hi> Lances, fled to their bataillion of foot, who ſtood not the charge neither, but ran away together with the horſe; and preſently the whole army reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the Enemy at their heeles, and it was an abſolute route. But <hi>Principius</hi> and <hi>Tarmutus</hi> with ſome few foot did things worthy their valour, and made a ſtand; fighting, and not induring to be routed, and the <hi>Goths</hi> admiring their reſolution. By their means the foot, and moſt of the horſe eſcaped with more eaſe. <hi>Principius</hi> with his body hewen in peices fell upon the place, and neer him two and forty of the foot. But <hi>Tarmutus</hi> with an <hi>Iſaurian</hi> Javeling in either hand kept off the aſſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants, and being ſpent with perpetuall knocks, his Brother came to his ſuccour with ſome horſe, which revived him, that with full ſpeed he ran to the walls full of ſweat and wounds, and having ſtill both his Javelins. Being a ſtrong man and ſwift, hee got cleer (though in that caſe) as far as to <hi>Porta Pinciana,</hi> where he fell downe. His companions thinking him dead, brought him in upon a ſheild. He ſurvived onely two dayes and then dyed, leaving a great name behind him in the whole Army. The <hi>Romans</hi> within were terrified, guarded the walls, and tumultuouſly ſhut the gates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the flying ſouldiers, fearing the Enemy might enter with them pell mell. Such Souldiers, as had not gotten within the walls already, leapt over the ditch, and with their backs to the walls ſtood trembling, unable to keep off the <hi>Goths</hi> (ready to leap over the Ditch to them) in regard their Lances were broken, and their bowes they could not uſe ſtanding ſo cloſe to one another. While few were on the battlements, the <hi>Goths</hi> preſt on to cut them in peices, and all that were left behind; but when they ſaw numbers of Souldiers and common people upon the battlements ready to reſiſt, they rode back deſpairing thereof after ſome railing words. And thus the fight, which began at the <hi>Goths</hi> Trenches, ended at the ditch and city Wall.</p>

Both of them were lined with Foot marching at their Horſes ſides; and ever the <hi>Romans</hi> had the better of the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians. Beſſas</hi> in one Encounter, charging the Enemy with his Lance, killed three of their beſt Horſe-men, and made the reſt run away. <hi>Conſtantianus</hi> at another time, led the <hi>Hunnes</hi> into <hi>Neros</hi> Feilds about the Evening, and finding himſelfe over-matcht in numbers, he did thus. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a great old <hi>Stadium</hi> ſtanding there (where formerly the Fencers uſed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat) are many houſes built, and conſequently divers narrow Lanes. <hi>Conſtantianus</hi> not able to Encounter the <hi>Goths</hi> multitude, nor yet ſafely to run from them, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the <hi>Hunnes</hi> to alight from their Horſes, and with them made a ſtand in a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Lane; and ſhooting the Enemy from a ſecure place, killed many. The <hi>Goths</hi> a while ſtood their ſhot, hoping when the <hi>Hunnes</hi> Quivers were empty, to take them all Priſoners good cheap; But they being good Archers, and ſhooting at a multitude, almoſt at every ſhot killed an Enemy, that halfe their number ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be loſt. And being about Sun-ſet, and having no place to be ſafe in, they ran away; and the <hi>Hunnes</hi> purſuing them cloſe, and being excellent to ſhoot up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the full ſpeed, killed them as faſt as before, and at night came back to <hi>Rome</hi> with <hi>Conſtantianus.</hi> Some daies after <hi>Peranius</hi> fallied at <hi>Porta Salaria</hi> with <hi>Romans,</hi> and routed the <hi>Gothes.</hi> The over-throw being ſuddain, and about Sun-ſet, a <hi>Roman</hi> Foot-man in the tumult fell into a Pit, there being many anciently made in that place to lay up Corn in. He durſt not cry out ſo neer the Enemies Camp, and he could not get up; ſo there he ſtaied all night, the next day the <hi>Barbariaus</hi> being again routed, a <hi>Goth</hi> fell into the ſame Pit. They here grew acquainted; neceſſity

The <hi>Goths</hi> ran to the Pit, and askt who made that crying: The <hi>Roman</hi> by agreement between them was ſilent, and the other prayed them in their Language, to let down a Rope to lift him up; they threw in a Rope, which the <hi>Roman</hi> firſt catcht, and ſaid, that he being up, the <hi>Goths</hi> would not leave their Companion behind, but would make no account to ſave him being an Enemy, and ſo got up. The <hi>Goths</hi> when they ſaw him, wondred, but hearing the Story, took up the other, who went along with them, and the <hi>Roman</hi> was permitted to go to the City without harm. Some Bravadoes there were often between ſmall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Horſe, as if they would fight; but ſtill the Quarrell ended in a Duell, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Romans</hi> ever had the Victory. At an Encounter in <hi>Nero's</hi> Feilds, there being many Chaſes on both ſides by the Horſe, <hi>Chorſomantis</hi> of the Life-guard to <hi>Beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarius,</hi> by Birth a <hi>Hunne,</hi> purſued with ſome others 70. <hi>Goths;</hi> who being gon far, the reſt rode back, only <hi>Chorſomantis</hi> followed ſtill; the <hi>Goths</hi> turn'd about at him, and he killed on of their beſt men, and routed the reſt: They fearing that they were ſeen from their Trenches, and aſhamed, charging him again, and again, after the loſſe of another of their beſt men, were made to run away as faſt as before; and <hi>Chorſomantis</hi> chaſed them up to the Trenches, and then returned all alone. Not long after at another Fight he was ſhot into the left leg to the bone, and lying for the cure unſerviceable, he chafed (being a <hi>Barbarian</hi>) and threatned to be even with the <hi>Goths,</hi> for the wrong they had done his leg. When he was well, and had drunk ſtore of Wine at his Dinner, out he went towards the Enemy to be revenged for his leg; he told the Sentinels at <hi>Porta pinciana,</hi> that <hi>Beliſarius</hi> ſent him to the Enemies Camp, who not miſtruſting one of the Generals Guard, opened the Gate, and let him go out. The Enemy ſeeing him, took him for a Fugitive; but when he was come neer, and fell to uſe his Bow, ſome twenty came upon him, whom he ſhook off and retired a foot pace; more came on, yet he would not run away, and ſtill reſiſting (though more ſtill charging him.) The <hi>Romans</hi> from the Turrets ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, thought him ſome mad man, not knowing it to be <hi>Chorſomantis,</hi> who did there brave things, and highly to be commended: but at laſt being compaſſed by the Enemy, he paid the penalty of his fool-hardineſſe. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> and the Army (when they knew who it was) mourned for him, as if all their hopes had periſhed with him.</p>

               <p>BUT about Midſommer, <hi>Euthalius</hi> arrived at <hi>Taracina,</hi> with Monies from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> owing to the Army; who fearing the Enemy, and his Money, wrote to <hi>Beliſarius</hi> to conduct him ſafe into <hi>Rome,</hi> who ſent out a 100. of his Targetiers, with two of his Lanciers to <hi>Taracina,</hi> to convoy the Treaſure, and himſelfe made a ſhew of giving Battell to the whole Army, to amuſe the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my from going out upon occaſion of Forraging. The nex day hearing <hi>Euthalius</hi> with his convoy would arrive, he ordered his Army for a Fight; and knowing <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalius</hi> would enter by night, he ſtood all the morning neer the Gates in Armes, and at Noon he commanded the Army to dine; the <hi>Goths</hi> did likewiſe, thinking that he put off the Battell till the next day: Then he ſent <hi>Martinus,</hi> and <hi>Valerianus</hi> to <hi>Nero's</hi> Feilds, to give Alarmes to the Enemy there. And at <hi>Porta Pinciana</hi> he ſent out 600.

At laſt they grew angry, and the Fight being hot, many, and of the beſt fell, and ſeconds came in from the City and the Camp; from whence (the Skirmiſh grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more and more) the ſhouts filled the Combatants with Courage.

This was the Succeſſe here; but in <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro's</hi> Feilds the <hi>Goths</hi> had the better: <hi>Martinus</hi> and <hi>Valerianus</hi> ſuſtaining their great numbers, with much difficulty and danger. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> commanded <hi>Buchas,</hi> who was come off untoucht, to ride up to <hi>Nero's</hi> Feilds, to ſuccour there; who falling on ſuddenly, and in the Evening, defeated them: but charging himſelfe too far, he was compaſt by twelve Enemies with Lances; which troubled him not, his Corſelet holding good againſt the puſhes thereof, till a <hi>Goth</hi> thruſt him behind un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his right arme-hole, which Wound was not mortall: but another thruſt him into the left thigh, and cut the Muſcle acroſſe. <hi>Valerianus,</hi> and <hi>Martinus,</hi> rode ſpeedily to his reſcue, and beat off the Enemy, then led him into the City, taking his Horſe by the Bridle. Night being come, <hi>Euthalius</hi> entred the City with the Treaſure, and all being within, they lookt to their hurt men; the Surgeons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to take the Arrow out of <hi>Arzes</hi> Face, but demurred; not in reſpect of the eye (which they had no thought to ſave) but leaſt by tearing the Membranes and Nerves there-about, they might kill one of the braveſt men of <hi>Beliſarius</hi> reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new. One of them (named <hi>Theoctiſtus</hi>) preſſing with his hand behind upon the neck, askt if it pained him; he anſwering that it did: then (quoth the Surgeon) your life is ſafe, and your Sight unhurt. This his confidence was, becauſe he found the head of the Arrow not far from the Skin; ſuch of the Shaft which ſtuck out, he cut off and threw away, then opened the Fibres, or ſmall Strings, where his pain was moſt, and drew out the Arrow head with the reſt of the Shaft that way with eaſe; So <hi>Arzes</hi> was not only unmaimed, but had not ſo much as a Skar left in his Face.

               <p>SOone after the middle of the Summer, the City was viſited with Famine, and Peſtilence, and the Souldier alſo was in want of Corn, but of no other Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But the Citizens beſides that want, were ſorely preſt with the Famine, and Peſtilence. The <hi>Goths</hi> found it, and reſolved to hazard no more Fights; but with Garriſons to hinder the importing Proviſions to the Enemy. Two Aquaeducts between <hi>Via Latina,</hi> and <hi>Via Appia,</hi> high built with goodly Arches, meet at a place about ſix miles from <hi>Rome;</hi> then that which took the right-hand way before, goes to the left, croſſing one another, and again they meet, and ſever again, incloſing the ground in the middle; and the <hi>Goths</hi> damming up the Arches with Stone, and Earth, made it as a Caſtle, and lodged in it a Garriſon of 7000. men, to cut of the <hi>Roman</hi> Forragers. The <hi>Romans</hi> then grew hopeleſſe, compaſſed with every ſpecies of miſery. While the Corn was, ſome Souldiers (the moſt daring) rode out in the night, and cut off the Eares, and brought them in unſeen by the Enemy, upon ſpare Horſes, and ſould them to the Rich for great Sums. The reſt lived upon Graſſe growing within, and neer the Walls, (The Feilds about <hi>Rome</hi> being green with Graſſe Summer, and Winter, which ſerved the Army for their Horſes.) Some
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50471:96"/>made Sauſſages of Mules fleſh which died in the Towne, and ſould them ſecretly. But the Corn being gone, and the Citizens in extremity, they flockt about <hi>Beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarius,</hi> urging him to end all in one Battell, and promiſing that not a Citizen ſhould be abſent from it. He was much troubled, and the Commons ſtill importuned; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <q>that their preſent Condition had over-taken them ſuddenly, and that their hopes ended in the quite contrary; having gotten what they longed for, and yet now being in this Calamity: And their former Opinion of doing well, in affecting the Emperours Protection, being now their folly, and the ground of their miſery, which now neceſſitated them to a daring, and again to put on Armes againſt the Enemy. They craved Pardon, though ſawcy with <hi>Beliſarius.</hi> A hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry belly knowes no modeſty; and their fool-hardineſſe to fight, Fortune muſt excuſe, ſeeing life prolonged in miſery, is of all the moſt grievous. That he ſaw their caſe, their Farmes in the Country in the Enemies hands, and their City blockt up; the Citizens lying dead without earth to cover them, and the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivers wiſhing their Carkaſſes lying by them; all miſchiefes being made tolerable by the Plague, and forgotten, when that appeares, it making all other Deaths, but from it ſelfe, a kind of pleaſure. They prayed leave to try their Fortune in Fight, before the ſickneſſe had utterly ſubdued them; either they ſhould conquer, or be rid of their troubles. Men who have hope in delaying, are unwiſe to hazard all with forwardneſſe; but in ſuch as find their match the worſe by deferring, a little delay is more to be blamed, then inſtant raſhneſſe. To this Speech <hi>Beliſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> made this anſwer; This is no more then I expected from you: I know what an inconſiderate thing a common People is; who neither can beare the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, nor provide for the future; only it can attempt Impoſſibilities, and ruine it ſelfe unadviſedly. But let me never willingly deſtroy you, and the Emperours Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires by your negligence. The War proſpers not by bruitiſh eagerneſſe, but by weighing the Opportunities wiſely, and with conſultation. You thinking you are at Dice, will throw at all; but it is my manner not to chuſe haſty, but profitable counſels. You promiſe to fight with the Enemy in our Company: ſince when have you been trained to your Armes? and were you perfect therein, who knowes not, that a Battell is, not proper to try Maſteries in? In the Fight the Enemy will not give you leave to practiſe, and learn. I commend therefore your forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and pardon this Tumult. But why it is not ſeaſonable, and why we uſe a provident backwardneſſe, I will tell you. The Emperour hath ſent a mighty Army gathered out of all Lands, and a Fleet (the like whereof the <hi>Romans</hi> never had) covering the ſhores of <hi>Campania,</hi> and much of the <hi>Jonian</hi> Gulfe. Theſe Forces are coming to us, and will deliver you from your feares, and over-whelme the <hi>Barbarians</hi> with their Arrowes; and I defer our fighting till their Arrivall, to get rather a ſecure Victory, then by adventring without reaſon, to abandon our ſafety; and I will take order, they ſhall be with us without delay.</q> 
                  <hi>Beliſarius</hi> with this quieted the Commons, and diſmiſt them. And it being reported, that the Emperour, would ſend Forces to <hi>Naples,</hi> he diſpatcht <hi>Procopius</hi> thither, the Writer of his Hiſtory, with Inſtructions to freight Ships with Corn, and to aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Souldiers come from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and the Horſe-men quartred in thoſe Countries; and marching then into <hi>Campania,</hi> to take alſo ſome out of every Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and to convoy the Corn to <hi>Oſtia. Procopius</hi> went out at Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Gate, with <hi>Mundilas</hi> one of the Life-guard, and ſome Horſe-men, and were not ſeen by the Enemy, quartered by <hi>Via Appia.</hi> When <hi>Mundilas</hi> at his return, reported how <hi>Procopius</hi> was by that time in <hi>Campania,</hi> without meeting a <hi>Goth,</hi> who went not out of their Camp in the night, they all took hart: And <hi>Beliſarius</hi> grown bolder, ſent ſtore of Horſe to the next Fortreſſes, from thence to charge the Enemies For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragers, and to lay Ambuſhes to cut of their bringing Proviſions to the Camp, that by this the City might be leſſe vexed with wants, and the <hi>Goths</hi> might be beſeiged more then It. He ſent <hi>Martinus,</hi> and <hi>Traianus</hi> with a 1000. men to convoy his Wife <hi>Antonina</hi> to <hi>Taracina,</hi> and from thence to give her a convoy to <hi>Naples;</hi> where ſhe was to expect the Event in a ſafe place. And he ſent <hi>Magnus,</hi> and <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thues,</hi> one of his Life-guard, with 500. men to the Caſtle of <hi>Tibur;</hi> ſtanding about 17. miles from <hi>Rome.</hi> To the ſmall City of <hi>Alba,</hi> ſtanding ſo many miles alſo from <hi>Rome,</hi> upon <hi>Via Appia,</hi> he had before ſent <hi>Gontharis</hi> with ſome <hi>Herulians;</hi> whom
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50471:96"/>the Enemy beat out from thence a while after. There ſtands a Church of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> a mile and three quarters from the walls of <hi>Rome</hi> upon the <hi>Tiber.</hi> It is not fortified, but a <hi>Porticus</hi> reaches to it from the City, which with the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings upon it make the place not eaſily to be invaded. The <hi>Goths</hi> alſo ſo much reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence thoſe two Apoſtles, that during the ſiege no hurt was done to either of theſe Temples, but the preiſts celebrated divine Service in them as formerly. In this place <hi>Beliſarius</hi> commanded <hi>Valerianus</hi> with all the <hi>Hunnes</hi> to intrench upon the bancks of <hi>Tiber,</hi> thereby to favour the paſturing of their own Horſe, and to reſtrain the <hi>Goths</hi> from coming out ſo far at their pleaſure. <hi>Valerianus</hi> encamped the <hi>Hunns</hi> accordingly, and then returned to the City, And <hi>Beliſarius</hi> having ſetled theſe things, lay ſtill, reſolving to begin no fight, but to defend only the walls from harm, and to ſome of the Commons he diſtributed corne.</p>

               <p>BUT <hi>Martinus</hi> and <hi>Trajanus,</hi> paſt in the night by the Enemies camps, came to <hi>Taracina,</hi> and ſent <hi>Antonina</hi> with a convoy into <hi>Campania;</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſeiſed the fortreſſes there about: from whence iſſuing and charging ever ſuddenly, they reſtrained the <hi>Goths</hi> inroads that way. <hi>Magnus</hi> alſo, and <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thues,</hi> repaired the decayes of the caſtle of <hi>Tibur,</hi> and from a ſafe place infeſted the Enemy, and a fortification they had not far off, frighting with unlook't for char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges their convoys of proviſions: Untill <hi>Synthues</hi> by a hurt of a Lance upon his right hand, was diſabled, his ſinews being cut aſunder. The <hi>Hunnes</hi> alſo, quarter'd neer there about, did the <hi>Goths</hi> as much hurt; that the Famine vexed them, having not proviſions brought ſo freely; and the plague killed many, eſpecially in the camp neer <hi>Via Appia;</hi> where the few that eſcaped ran to the other intrenchments: The <hi>Hunnes</hi> alſo ſuffered the like, and went back to <hi>Rome.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Procopius</hi> in <hi>Campania</hi> got together 500 ſouldiers, and ſhips freighted with corn, and when <hi>Antonina</hi> came, ſhe took care with him to ſet out the fleet. <hi>Veſuvius</hi> then bellowed, but did not caſt up, which was expected; and the inhabitants were terribly frighted. This mountain ſtands eight miles three quarters from <hi>Naples</hi> northward, ſteep, and thick with wood below, and above craggy and very wild. At the top is a deep cave, ſeeming to reach to the bottom of the mountaine, and if you peep in, you may ſee fire, which ordinarily keeps in, not troubling the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; But when the mountain bellowes like an Oxe, ſoon after it caſts out far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a huge quantity of cynders, which catching a man upon the way, he hath no means to ſave his life; if it fall upon houſes, they fall with the weight; if the wind blow ſtiff, it riſes up paſt ones ſight, and is carryed by the wind to very farr coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes. They ſay, it fell once in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which ſo frighted the Citizens, that to this day they have yearly publick ſupplications to appeaſe God; and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother time it fell in <hi>Tripolis.</hi> Formerly this bellowing came every 100 yeares, or more, but ſince oftner. When the <hi>Veſuvius</hi> caſts out cynders, they are confident of a plentifull year: the aire about it is pure, and none more healthy; that the Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſend thither men far gone in Conſumptions.</p>
               <p>But from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> arrived at <hi>Naples</hi> 3000 Iſaurians, commanded by <hi>Paulus</hi> and <hi>Conon,</hi> and at <hi>Otranto</hi> 800 horſe, <hi>Thracians,</hi> led by <hi>John,</hi> Siſters Son of that <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talianus,</hi> who formerly rebelled againſt the Emperour. With them were a 1000 more horſemen, commanded by <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Marcentius,</hi> and others. <hi>Zeno</hi> with 300 horſe was already come to <hi>Rome</hi> through <hi>Samnium,</hi> and by <hi>Via Latina. John</hi> and the reſt coming into <hi>Campania</hi> with many waggons out of <hi>Calabria,</hi> and joyning the 500 levied (as I ſaid) in <hi>Campania,</hi> marcht by the Sea ſhore with their waggons, which they were to fortifie with, in caſe of an Enemies aſſault. <hi>Paulus</hi> &amp; <hi>Conon</hi> they ſent by ſea with their troops, to joyn with them at <hi>Oſtia,</hi> having put corn ſufficient in their waggons &amp; fraighted the ſhips therewith, &amp; with wine and other proviſions. They thought to find <hi>Martinus</hi> &amp; <hi>Trajanus</hi> about <hi>Taracina,</hi> but they were newly ſent for and gone to <hi>Rome. Beliſarius</hi> fearing the Enemy with multitudes might cut off the troopes marching with <hi>John,</hi> and having at the beginning of the warre
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50471:97"/>ram'd up <hi>Porta Flaminia</hi> with ſtones, that the Enemy encamping neer it, might not there force the city (neither was there ever any fight there, nor did the <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> looke for any Enemy thence) from this gate he took away the ſtones ſecretly, and put there in armes the greateſt part of his army, and at day-break he ſent out <hi>Diogenes</hi> and <hi>Trajanus,</hi> by <hi>Porta Pinciana,</hi> with a thouſand horſe, to ſhoot into the Enemies quarters, and when they came out to run away, upon the full ſpeed to the town walls. They accordingly provoked the <hi>Goths,</hi> who from all their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters encountred them; and both parts came upon the ſpeed towards the walls, the one flying the other purſuing. When <hi>Beliſarius</hi> ſaw the Enemy upon the chaſe, he opened <hi>Porta Flaminia,</hi> and drew out the army unexpected. Neer the high way, there was one of their camps and before it a narrow lane craggy and hard to paſſe: where a <hi>Barbarian</hi> gallant and well armed, ſeeing the Enemy coming ran and prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed the ſaid paſſage, calling to his companions to help to maintain it; but <hi>Mundilas</hi> overtook him and killed him, not ſuffering any of the reſt to come to the Lane. So they went through without oppoſition to the Enemies quarter: which ſome attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but could not take it, though few were within, by reaſon the ditch was deep and the Earth caſt up inward, and was raiſed to a kind of a wall, and the ſtakes were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well pitcht and thick, wherein the <hi>Goths</hi> truſting reſiſted valiantly. <hi>Aquilinus</hi> a Targetier of <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> and very valiant, leapt into the quarter, drawing his horſe by the bridle after, and ſome he killed; but they darted thick at him, and killed his horſe, himſelf eſcaped ſtrangely through the Enemy, and went towards <hi>Porta Pinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi> with his fellowes, who overtook the <hi>Goths</hi> yet purſuing and killed them ſhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them behind. <hi>Trajanus</hi> with his troopes ſeeing it, (their horſe there alſo ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding) gallopt againſt the purſuing <hi>Goths,</hi> who ſurprized between the Enemy thus, were ſlain in confuſion; and the ſlaughter was great, and few recovered their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: Which they were all afraid of, kept in, and fortified; expecting a preſent aſſult. In this fight <hi>Trajanus</hi> was ſhot above his right eye, neer the noſe. The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row head though broad and long ſtuck faſt, and was not ſeen; but the ſhaft fell off, the head being looſe ſet. <hi>Trajanus</hi> felt it not, but continued chaſing and killing, &amp; 5 years after the point of the arrow head appeared of it ſelf out of his fore head. This is the third year that ſtill by little and little it comes out; and in time 'tis thought it will all come out. In the mean time it is no trouble to him at all.</p>

               <p>BUT the <hi>Goths</hi> upon theſe ſucceſſes deſpaired of the warr, and thought of reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, being reduced by the plague and Ememy from many thouſands to a few, pincht with famin, excluded from all proviſions, and in ſhew beſieging, but indeed beſieged themſelves.

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50471:97"/>it from the <hi>Romans;</hi> but <hi>Odoacer</hi> had depoſed the Emperour and changed the ſtate into a Tyranny: and <hi>Zeno,</hi> then Emperour of the Eaſt, deſiring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge his fellow Emperor upon the uſurper, &amp; to free the Province, but unable to ſuppreſſe <hi>Odoacer,</hi> perſwaded our Prince <hi>Theodoriok,</hi> (ready then to beſiege him in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>) to lay down that quarrell, being a <hi>Patritian,</hi> and having been a <hi>Roman</hi> Conſull; and by revenging the wrong done to <hi>Auguſtulus,</hi> upon <hi>Odoacer,</hi> to become with the <hi>Goths</hi> lawfull maſter of the province. Thus we received the Dominion of <hi>Italy,</hi> and have maintained the Common-Wealth and Lawes, as much as any Emperour. There is not one new Law made by <hi>Theodorick,</hi> nor any of his Succeſſors, written, nor unwritten. And concerning Faith and Gods Worſhip, we have conſerved them exactly, that not an <hi>Italian</hi> willingly nor unwillingly hath changed his Religion, and when <hi>Goths</hi> have changed, it hath not been queſtioned. The <hi>Romans</hi> Churches have been by us held in higheſt Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and none flying to them hath been violated. The great Offices the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> have had, not a <hi>Goth</hi> hath been advanced to any. If any man think this not to be ſo, let him ſtand out and diſprove me. Nay the <hi>Goths</hi> have given way, that the <hi>Roman Conſulſhip</hi> ſhould yearly be conferred on <hi>Romans,</hi> by the Eaſtern Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.

               <p>
                  <q>Be gone therefore from us, keeping what is yours, and the Booties you have taken. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> replied: Your promiſe was to be briefe and moderate, but your diſcourſe hath been tedious, and ſomething inſolent. The Emperour <hi>Zeno</hi> ſent <hi>Theodorick</hi> againſt <hi>Odoacer,</hi> not to be King of <hi>Italy</hi> (for to him what diſtinction could be between one Uſurper and another?) but that it might be free and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the Emperour. And <hi>Theodorick</hi> did good Service againſt the Uſurper, but in the reſt proved extreamly ungratefull; never bethinking himſelfe to reſtore the Country to the Lord thereof. He that ejects forcibly, and he that reſtores not what is his Neighbours, is the ſame man. For me, I may not give away the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Provinces: If you would have any thing elſe, ſpeak on. <hi>Ambaſſadour.</hi> You know all, that we have ſpoken nothing but truth.

               <p>AFTER often meetings, they concluded a Ceſſation, and to give Hoſtages mutually of eminent men. During this negotiation, the Fleet of <hi>Iſaurians</hi> came into the Haven of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Troops of <hi>John</hi> to <hi>Oſtia,</hi> without the Enemies interruption to land or encamp. The <hi>Iſaurians</hi> to lodge ſecurely from the Enemie, drew a deep Ditch neer the Haven, and kept guards; and <hi>John</hi> lay fenced within his Waggons. At night <hi>Beliſarius</hi> came to <hi>Oſtia</hi> with a 100. Horſe, acquainting them with the occurrents, and concluſion with the <hi>Goths,</hi> &amp; command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to ſend up their lading, and to goe boldly to <hi>Rome;</hi> promiſing them to ſecure the way for them: himſelfe before day rode back into the City. When it was day, <hi>Antonina</hi> conſulted with the Commanders about ſending up their lading; which ſeemed difficult, and ſcarce faiſible. The Oxen were halfe dead, and could not
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50471:98"/>hold out: and it was unſafe to go with their Waggons in a way ſo narrow; and to draw Lighters up the River, as formerly, was impoſſible; the left hand way by the ſame being poſſeſſed (as I ſaid) by the Enemie, and not paſſable for the <hi>Romans;</hi> and by the other bank was no paſſage at all: So that taking the Cock-boats of the greater Ships, and walling them round with boards, to guard the men from ſhot, they put aboard thoſe Boats a proportion of Archers, and Marriners; and ſtowing as much as they could carry in them, and getting a wind, they ſailed up the <hi>Tiber;</hi> a part of the Army winging them on the right hand ſhore: And they left a ſtrong guard of <hi>Iſaurians</hi> in the Ships. Their ſailes they tooke from the Enemy, and went up with eaſe. Only where the Stream with an eddy went ſide-long, their ſails had no wind for them, and the Marriners rowed, and with much toyle forced up. The <hi>Barbarians</hi> interrupted them not, either fearing to hazard, or not thinking proviſions could be imported that way. And they held it inconvenient to croſſe the Ceſſation promiſed, upon a ſlight occaſion; In <hi>Portus</hi> alſo the <hi>Goths</hi> medled not with them, as they ſayled by them, wondring what their intent was. Having in this manner, ſailing to and fro, imported their ladings; the Marriners went away with the Ships, it being now toward the Winter <hi>Tropick.</hi> The reſt of the Army en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred <hi>Rome,</hi> ſave <hi>Paulus,</hi> who ſtaid in <hi>Oſtia</hi> with ſome <hi>Iſaurians.</hi> Afterward they gave Hoſtages for obſerving the Ceſſation, the Romans <hi>Zeno,</hi> and the Goths, <hi>

The <hi>Goths</hi> in the Caſtle of <hi>Portus</hi> wanting proviſions, quitted it, and came to the camp by <hi>Vitigis</hi> direction: The place <hi>Paulus</hi> with his <hi>Iſaurians</hi> from <hi>Oſtia</hi> ſurprized. It was the <hi>Romans</hi> being Maſters of the Sea, which cauſed theſe wants of Victuall, permitting no Proviſions to come to the <hi>Barbarians.</hi> Upon the like ſcarcity they quitted then alſo <hi>Centumcellae,</hi> a Sea Towne of much importance, great, and popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and ſtanding in <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> 35. miles to the Weſt of <hi>Rome.</hi> The taking of it much ſtrengthened the <hi>Romans:</hi> and of <hi>Alba</hi> likewiſe, ſtanding to the Eaſt of <hi>Rome,</hi> and abandoned by the Enemy for the ſame reaſon. So that the <hi>Romans</hi> compaſſed them round; which made the <hi>Goths</hi> eager to breake the Accord, and to do them miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe. They ſent Ambaſſadors to <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> complaining, that <hi>Vitigis</hi> having up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome occaſion ſent for the <hi>Goths</hi> from the Caſtle of <hi>Portus, Paulus</hi> without any reaſon had ſurprized it; and pretending the like for <hi>Alba</hi> and <hi>Centumcellae,</hi> with menaces, if they had not reſtitution. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> ſent them away, laughing at their pretext, all men knowing why they quitted thoſe places. From hence forward they were ſuſpicious of each other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beliſarius</hi> ſeeing then <hi>Rome</hi> ſtrong with Souldiers, ſent out many parties of Horſe to places neer <hi>Rome:</hi> And <hi>Vitalianus, Johns</hi> Nephew, to winter about <hi>Alba</hi> in <hi>Pice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> with his own 800.

Being come to <hi>Spoletum,</hi> he lodged in a Church without the Walls, which <hi>Conſtantianus,</hi> (then there) underſtanding, ſent <hi>Maxentiolus,</hi> one of his Targetiers, and took the Cimiters from him; who being grieved at the wrong, went to <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Beliſarius;</hi> whether ſoon after came <hi>Conſtantianus</hi> alſo, the <hi>Goths</hi> Army being reported to be neer. While the <hi>Romans</hi> were in trouble and danger, <hi>Perſidius</hi> was ſilent; but they having the better, and the <hi>Goths</hi> Embaſſadours being diſpatched to the Empetour, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted <hi>Beliſarius</hi> with the Injury, praying his aſſiſtance in his juſt Cauſe; who in Perſon, and by others reproved <hi>Conſtantianus,</hi> and adviſed him to waſh his hands of ſo foule an Imputation. <hi>But Conſtantianus</hi> (who was to have a miſchiefe) put off the adviſe with a Jeſt, and flouted the man he had wronged. Who meeting <hi>Beliſarius</hi> riding through the Market place, took his Horſe by the Bridle, and clamouring aloud, askt, if it were the Emperours Law, that when a poor Suppliant comes for refuge from <hi>Barbarians,</hi> any man may take from him what he hath about him. The Company threatned him, and bad him let go the Bridle; which he would not do, before <hi>Beliſarius</hi> promiſed to give him the Swords. The next day he called <hi>Conſtantianus</hi> and many Commanders to a Room in the Palace; putting him in mind of the Accident the day before, and (though late) to reſtore the Cimiters. He ſaid, he would ſooner throw them into the <hi>Tiber, Beliſarius</hi> grew angry; and askt, if he took not himſelfe to be under his command: In other things he profeſſed to obey him, ſince it was the Emperours pleaſure; but that which he now commanded, he would never do. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> then had his Guard to come in; is it to kill me, quoth <hi>Conſtantianus?</hi> no, ſaid <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> but to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell your Targetier <hi>Maxentiolus,</hi> to reſtore to the man his Swords, which he took from him by violence, and brought them to you. <hi>Conſtantianus</hi> ſuppoſing yet it was to kill him, thought firſt to do ſome brave Act; and drawing a ſhort Sword, made a thruſt ſuddently at the Belly of <hi>Beliſarius;</hi> who amazed ſtept back, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing <hi>Beſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then they hurt him not, reſpecting the Commanders pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but they led him to another Room, and there by <hi>Beliſarius</hi> Command, killed him. This was the only † impious Act ever done by <hi>Beliſarius,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">This Hiſtory is ſupplied in the ſecret Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; where it appeares to be impious indeed.</note> not conformable to the much moderation he had ſtill uſed to all men.

               <p>Shortly after the <hi>Goths</hi> had a deſigne upon <hi>Rome;</hi> They let down ſome men into an Aquaeduct, whoſe water they had cut off in the beginning of the Seige; theſe with Lamps, and Torches ſearched for an entrance into the City. Not far from <hi>Porta Pinciana,</hi> an Arch of this Aquaeduct had a breach in it, out of which a Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinell ſaw light, and told it his fellowes; they ſaid it was a Wolfe, there being no Land to be ſeen over the building of the Acquaeduct, they took it to be a Wolfes eyes, ſhewing like fire. The <hi>Goths</hi> in the Aquaeduct came into the midſt of the City,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50471:99"/>where had been an aſcent into the Palace, and found there a Building made by <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſarius,</hi> providently in the beginning of the Seige, which hindred their further paſſage, or aſcent. So they took a ſmall Stone out of it, and returned to <hi>Vitigis,</hi> ſhewing him the Stone, and relating the particulars; who held a Counſell about it. The next day the <hi>Romans</hi> upon the Guard at <hi>Porta Pinciana</hi> had ſpeech of their ſuſpition about the Wolfe; which being ſpred, and coming to the wiſe Generall, he did not ſlightly give eare to it, but inſtantly let down into the Aquaeduct <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes,</hi> one of his Life-guard, with ſome choice men, to ſearch; who found ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Lamps of the Enemy, and droppings of Torches, and ſaw where they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out the Stone, and reported all to <hi>Beliſarius;</hi> whereupon he kept a ſtrong Guard upon the Aquaeduct: which the <hi>Goths</hi> perceiving, forbare the attempt. But they prepared to give an open Aſſault; and at dinner time with ſcaling Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and fire, they came unlookt for to <hi>Porta Pinciana,</hi> hoping to take the City ſo by a ſudden on-ſet, few Souldiers being left within it. <hi>Ildeger</hi> then kept the Watch with his Company, every man being appointed to guard by turnes. Seeing the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my approach diſorderly, he charged them not ranckt for a Fight, but marching in confuſion, and he routed and killed them. At the noiſe the <hi>Romans</hi> ran up to the Walls, and the Goths without doing any thing retired. <hi>Vitigis</hi> then had another deſigne; the Walls are very aſſaultable by the <hi>Tibers</hi> Banck, the Ancients ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving built the Wall careleſly there, and low, without Towers, truſting to the Fortification of the River. Here he hoped to take the City, there being no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable guard. He corrupted two <hi>Romans</hi> dwelling about Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Church, to repaire to the Sentinels there with a Veſſell of Wine about the Evening, and with ſome colour of kindneſſe, to beſtow the Wine on them, to ſit drinking with them till midnight, and to throw into their Cups a ſleepie Drug, which he gave them. He prepared Boats upon the oppoſite Shore, in which the <hi>Goths</hi> upon a Signall, (the Sentinels being aſleep) were to paſſe over and aſſault; and he put the whole Army in readineſſe to force the City. But one of the men hired for the Service, (<hi>Rome</hi> being not to be taken by that Army of <hi>Goths</hi>) revealed the Plot to <hi>Beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarius,</hi> and diſcovered his fellow; who upon torture opened all, and ſhewed the Drug given by <hi>Vitigis. Beliſarius</hi> cut of his Noſe, and Eares, and ſent him upon an Aſſe into the Enemies Camp; who ſeeing him, ſaw God preventing their Counſels, and therefore the City by them not to be taken.</p>

And the <hi>Goths</hi> having the newes of <hi>Ariminum,</hi> and their Proviſions failing, and the three Months being expired, made their Retreat, though they heard nothing of their Ambaſſadours ſucceſſe.

The <hi>Romans</hi> ſeeing them, doubted what to do, their main body of Horſe being not preſent; but ſent out ſeverall waies, as I have ſaid, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving themſelves not able to fight with ſuch multitudes: Yet <hi>Beliſarius</hi> armed his Horſe, and Foot; and more then halfe the Enemies being paſt over the Bridge, he ſallied at <hi>Porta Pinciana.</hi> The Fight came to the Sword, and Lance, and the <hi>Goths</hi> firſt ſtifly ſuſtaining the Enemy, many fell on both ſides: But afterward the <hi>Goths</hi> being routed, made their overthrow very great, by preſſing and crowding to paſſe the Bridge, that they ſuffered extraordinary loſſe, being killed by Enemies and one another. Many fell into the <hi>Tiber,</hi> and were drowned in their Armes; and having loſt moſt of their men, the reſt ever-took thoſe formerly paſt over. <hi>Longinus</hi> the <hi>Iſaurian,</hi> and <hi>Mundilas,</hi> two of <hi>Beliſarius</hi> his Life-guard, did extraordinarily in this Battell: <hi>Mundilas</hi> killed foure <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and came off; but <hi>Longinus</hi> having been the greateſt cauſe of the Enemies overthrow, fell upon the place, much lamented by the whole Army. <hi>Vitigis</hi> in his march toward <hi>Raven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> with the remainder of his Army, fortified the defenſible places with ſtrong Garriſons; leaving in <hi>Cluſium,</hi> a City in <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> a 1000. men under <hi>Gelimer,</hi> and as many in <hi>

Horſe to get before the Enemy into <hi>Ariminum,</hi> (taking ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e other way) and to cauſe <hi>John</hi> and his Troops to riſe from thence, placing in their ſtead other ſufficient numbers to guard the Town, and to be taken out of <hi>Ancona</hi> ſtanding upon the <hi>Jonian</hi> Gulfe, two daies journey from <hi>Ariminum;</hi> which he had taken in before, ſending <hi>Conon</hi> with an Army of <hi>Thracians,</hi> and <hi>Iſaurians.</hi> He hoped, that there being only Foot in <hi>Ariminum,</hi> and no Commanders of Note, the <hi>Goths</hi> would not imploy their powers to beſeige it, but deſpiſe it, and march on to <hi>Ravenna;</hi> and if they ſhould beſeige it, that Proviſions would laſt longer for Foot only, and that the 2000.

               <p>BUT thoſe Romans finding <hi>Petra</hi> in their way, attempted the Caſtle as a by-buſineſſe; a fortreſſe not made by men, but by the nature of the place, where is a craggy way, and to the right hand a ſwift running river unfordable; on the left hand a ſteep rock ſo high, that men on the top ſeem below like little birds. Anciently there was no paſſage through, but in time a way was dig'd through it, &amp; a gate made; the other entrance was walled, ſave ſo much as was left for a gate there, and ſo of it ſelf the place became of fortification, and was named † <hi>Petra,</hi>

And laſt behinde they forced their way up the crag, and threw ſtones upon the Enemies heads: they ran into the houſes, and there kept cloſe. The <hi>Romans</hi> when they could not reach them with ſtones, cut great peices out of the Rock, and with many hands toſſed
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50471:100"/>them down aiming at the houſes, ſuch as they light on tottered, and so frighted the <hi>Goths</hi> that they held up their hands to thoſe at the Gate, and yeilded upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, to have no hurt, but to be ſervants to the Emperour, and obedient to <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſarius. Martinus</hi> and <hi>Ildiger,</hi> removed the moſt of them, leaving ſome few with their wives &amp; children, &amp; placing a Garriſon of Romans, Then they went to <hi>Ancona</hi> from whence they took many foot companies, &amp; brought them the third day to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> declaring <hi>Beliſarius</hi> his direction. But <hi>John</hi> refuſed to go with them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained <hi>Damianus</hi> with his 400 men; ſo that leaving the foot companies, they went away with the Lanciers and Targetiers of <hi>Beliſarius.</hi> Soon after <hi>Vitigis</hi> with his whole army ſate downe before <hi>Ariminum.</hi> He made a woodden tower higher then the walis, and upon wheels brought it where the ſame were moſt aſſaultable: They drew it not on with oxen, leaſt they ſhould ſpeed as they did at <hi>Rome;</hi> but men covered within it, ſhoved it on: within it was a great broad ſcaling ladder for the common ſouldier to mount the battlements, they not doubting but to get up with eaſe ſo ſoon as their tower was ſet to the walls, ſo was the figure thereof contrived. Being come neer the walls with it, they lay ſtill, becauſe it grew dark, ſet their ſentinells about it, and took their reſt, dreaming of no oppoſition; there being but a ſmall trench only to hinder their approach. The <hi>Romans</hi> paſt the night in fear, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the next day to be ruined. But <hi>John</hi> neither deſpairing nor fearing, about midnight left the reſt upon their Guards, and himſelf with his <hi>Iſaurians</hi> carrying Mattocks and other inſtruments, got ſecretly without the walls, and cauſed them to dig in the trench, and to caſt up the Earth to the town-ward, which ſerved for a rampire, and in a ſmall time, the Enemy being faſt a ſleep, they made the Trench of reaſonable depth and breadth, where the walls were weakeſt, and the <hi>Goths</hi> were to approach with their tower: who (the night being far ſpent) perceived it, and ran to beat them off: but they, the trench being compleated, got within the walls. <hi>Vitigis</hi> was extreamly vexed at in the morning, &amp; put to death ſome ſentinells: and being as eager as ever, commanded to fill up the ditch with Faggots, and ſo to draw the tower on. They did his commands with alacrity, though mightily oppoſed from the walls. But the faggots with the weight of the Tower ſunk, that they could not get it forward, the Ground growing ſtill ſteeper, where the Earth was caſt up, as I ſayd. So that fearing the night approaching, and the Enemies ſallying to burn their Engin, they drew it back. <hi>John</hi> to hinder them, put the Souldiers in Armes, and uſed this Exhortation. "Fellow ſouldiers, and my partners in this danger, he that would live, and ſee thoſe he hath left at home; let him know that he holds <q>this hope by his ſword only. When <hi>Beliſarius</hi> ſent us out, the hope and Love of many things made us cheerfull in the buſineſſe. We ſuſpected not ſo neer the ſea (the Romans being maſters of the ſea) to be beſieged, nor imagined, that the Emperours army could ſo much neglect us. Then the occaſion of ſhewing our affection to the ſtate, and of getting Glory incouraged us; now, but by our va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, we cannot ſo much as live, and for life (were there nothing elſe) we muſt of neceſſity undergo this hazard. And who pretends to valour alſo, hath a fair opportunity this day to get Glory by it; which is gotten not by overcoming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours in power, but by a victory with leſſe preparations, and greater courage. And who love their lives beſt, ſhall gain moſt by daring; whoſe affaires (as ours now) are upon the Edge of a razor, ſuch as are preſerved only by deſpiſing dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</q> Having thus ſayd, he led them againſt the Enemy, leaving ſome upon the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements; the Enemy received them bravely, and it was hotly fought; and with much ado about Evening they brought their Tower to the Camp with loſſe of many good men, that they reſolved to aſſault no more; but lay ſtill to take the <hi>Romans</hi> by Famine; whoſe proviſions failed, and they knew not which way to get ſupply.</p>

               <p>THen came newes to <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> that <hi>Narſes</hi> was come from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> with an army, and was in <hi>Picenia, Narſes</hi> was an Evnuch, and Treaſurer to the Emperour, valiant above the condition of an Evnuch: with him came 5000 men in ſeverall Regiments, commanded by <hi>Juſtinus,</hi> Generall of <hi>Illyrium,</hi> and others; and another <hi>Narſes,</hi> a <hi>Perſ-Armenian,</hi> who revolted former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the <hi>Romans</hi> with <hi>Horatius</hi> his Brother, who came a little before to <hi>Beliſarius</hi> with other forces, and 2000 <hi>Herulians</hi> under <hi>Viſandus, Alueth,</hi> and <hi>Phanotheus.</hi> Formerly the <hi>Herulians</hi> inhabited beyond the river <hi>Iſter,</hi> ſerving many Gods, and holding it no impiety to appeaſe them with human ſacrifices. They had Lawes dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from other men: When men were grown aged or ſick, they were not to live, But to intreat their kindred to put them out of the world: Who made a pile of wood, and ſet the man in the top, and ſent a ſtranger to him, in blood, with a ſword to diſpatch him; then ſet the pile on fire, and the flame being done, gather'd up his Bones, and buried them. When an <hi>Herulian</hi> died, his wiſe (if ſhe would be thought vertuous) was to ſtrangle her ſelf over her husbands Tombe; otherwiſe ſhee was eſteemed infamous, and an Enemy to her husbands kindred. In time over-topping the bordering Barbarians in populouſneſſe and power, they vanquiſht them in fight one by one, and forraged their country, and kept them under. They ſubdued the Lombards being Chriſtians, and made them pay Tribute, upon Covetouſneſſe or vain glory, it being a thing not uſed by the Barbarians in thoſe parts. In the Raign of the Emperour <hi>Anaſtaſius,</hi> having none left to invade, they remained quiet for three years: But were diſcontented for it at their King <hi>Rodulphus,</hi> flocking about him, and calling him coward, and immodeſtly they ſcoft and abuſed him. Who not enduring the diſgrace, made a cauſeleſſe war upon the Lombards, not charging them with breach of Treaties, or any other pretence.

But <hi>Redulphus</hi> ſent their Ambaſſadors away with Threats. They ſent again other Ambaſſadors, who uſed much entreaty; but ſpeeding <q>not, the third came and adviſed him; In no ſort to make a war without a cauſe: if he did, the Lombards (though unwillingly) muſt oppoſe the invaſion; calling God to witneſſe, whoſe leaſt drop upon the ſcale will weigh down all the power of men, &amp; as he is induced by the cauſes, wil determin the concluſion of this war.</q> The <hi>Herulians</hi> not frighted herewith, nor relenting, reſolved to have a Battell. Both parts being neer each other; over the Lombards the aire was ſuddenly over caſt with a black thick cloud; there being a clear sky over the Herulians, a Preſage that the Herulians entred the fight for their own miſcheife, and among thoſe Barbarians before a battell the ſaddeſt prodigie that can be. But the Herulians, not heeding the ſame, marcht proudly againſt the Enemy, judging of the ſucceſſe by their great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes. But they were very many ſlain, with their King <hi>Rodulphus,</hi> and the reſt fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were almoſt all cut in peices.

And <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſius</hi> the Emperour received them, to plant in the country. Soon after by commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting much wickedneſſe upon their neighbouring Romans, they offended him, and he ſent an army againſt them; which in a battell had the victory, killed moſt of them, and would have deſtroyed them all; but their cheiftains remaining, with ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons begged their lives, and to be taken for Auxiliaries and Servants to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; who granted the ſame, and ſo ſome <hi>Herulians</hi> eſcaped alive, but neither ayded nor ſerved the Romans. <hi>Juſtinian</hi> coming to the Empire gave them a good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50471:101"/>and Goods, and made them abſolute Aſſociates, and perſwaded them to be Chriſtians; upon this they grew civiller, and applyed themſelves to the Lawes of Chriſtians, ſerving the <hi>Romans</hi> as Auxiliaries. But ſtill they are falſe to us, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous; not thinking it any ſhame to wrong their Neighbours. They uſe impious mixtures with men and Beaſts, being indeed the wickedeſt of all men, and wretches wretchedly to periſh.

To ſhew the lavageneſſe of their nature, they killed <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chon</hi> their King, ſuddenly, without alleadging any thing, but that they would no more be under a King. And indeed their King before had only the name, otherwiſe little advantage above a private man. All ſat and ate with him, and put licentious ſcornes on him; the <hi>Herulians</hi> being the moſt indiſcreet, and the lighteſt men alive.

The Sun a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Summer Tropick ſets not in the Iſland for fourty dayes, being in all that time a ſtrange ſight ſtill above the Earth. And neer the Winter Tropick, it is not ſeen in the Iſland for fourty dayes, but a continuall night hangs over it; the Inhabitants leading a ſad life all the while, and not converſing which one another. It was not my fortune to goe to this Iſland, though I much deſired to behold the wonder: But inquiring of ſome that came from thence, how they knew the due times of Sun-riſing and Sun-ſetting, they told me the true reaſon; That the Sun ſets not indeed there for fourty dayes, but it ſhines ſometimes from the Eaſtward, ſometimes from the Weſt; and when they ſee it returne to that place of the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon, where firſt they ſaw it riſe, they reckon a day and a night. And in the long nights they count the dayes by the courſes of the Moone, which they ſee every moneth. When five and thirty dayes are runn out of this long night, men uſed to it are ſent to the tops of the Mountaines, who there ſeeing the Sun, bring word that within five dayes it will ſhine againe. For this good newes a ſolemne Feaſt is celebrated in the dark; which is the <hi>Thulites</hi> greateſt Holy-day. They feare (it ſeemes, notwithſtanding their yearely experience) that the Sun may forſake them quite. Of all the Nations of <hi>Thule,</hi> onely the <hi>Scritifini</hi> are Savages, who uſe no apparrell, nor ſhooes to their feet, nor get any mans meat out of the earth; them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves neither manuring it, nor their Wives uſing any work, but both perpetually hunting; for their vaſt Woods and Mountaines breed multitudes of wilde Beaſts; which they, catch and feed upon their fleſh, covering themſelves with their Skins, which they patch together with Sinews of Beaſts, wanting thred, or any thing to ſow with. Their Children are not nurſed like other people, with Womans milke, nor hang at the Mothers breaſt, but are nouriſhed with the Marrow of the wilde Beaſts they take. The Woman having brought forth her childe, wraps it in a Skin, and hangs it on a Tree, and laying Marrow to the mouth of it, out ſhee goes a hunting with her Husband.</p>
               <p>The reſt of the <hi>Thulites</hi> differ not much from other people. They worſhip many Gods, and <hi>Damons,</hi> both Coeleſtiall, and of the Ayre, Earth, and Sea; and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ſayd to be in Fountaines, and Rivers. They are perpetually ſacrificing, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50471:102"/>with blood; and their faireſt Victime is a Man, before taken Priſoner, whom they ſacrifice to <hi>Mars,</hi> eſteemed their greateſt God. And they doe it, not by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his throat onely, but hanging him on a tree, and throwing him among Bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and other kinds of death. Among theſe <hi>Thulites</hi> the <hi>Herulian</hi> wanderers, planted themſelves; and thoſe who continued among the <hi>Romans,</hi> having murdered their King, ſent ſome chiefe men to the Iſland of <hi>Thule,</hi> to bring home one of the blood royall, if they could finde any there. They found many, and made choice of one whom they liked beſt, and tooke him with them. But being come neer home, he dyed of a ſickneſſe; and the men went againe to <hi>Thule,</hi> and brought another, named <hi>Todaſius,</hi> accompanied with his Brother <hi>Aordus,</hi> and two hundred <hi>Heruli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> of the Iſland. Who being long upon their journey, the <hi>Herulians</hi> about <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedon</hi> conceiving it might be inconvenient to introduce a King from <hi>Thule,</hi> without the Emperour <hi>Juſtinians</hi> conſent, to <hi>Conſtaneinople</hi> to the Emperour, to give them what King he pleaſed: He ſent them <hi>Suartuas,</hi> an <hi>Herulian,</hi> who had long continued in <hi>Conſtantiople,</hi> whom the <hi>Herulians</hi> at firſt received joyfully, adored him as King, and obeyed him in the uſuall directions: But within few daies, they had newes how the Ambaſſadours from <hi>Thule</hi> were neer. <hi>Suartuas</hi> commanded them to go out and kill them; and the <hi>Herulians</hi> followed him with a ſeeming ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation; but being within a daies journey of them, they revolted from him by night to the new commers, and himſelfe alone fled to <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour was ſtudious to reſtore him; and the <hi>Herulians</hi> fearing the <hi>Romans,</hi> betook themſelves to the <hi>Gepaedes:</hi> And this was the cauſe of their Revolt.</p>

               <p>THE Armies of <hi>Beliſarius</hi> and <hi>Narſes</hi> joyned at <hi>Firma,</hi> a City ſtanding neer the <hi>Jonian</hi> Gulfe, a daies journey from <hi>Auximum.</hi> They held a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of War where to oppoſe the Enemy with beſt advantage. If they go to releive <hi>Auximum,</hi> they doubted the Enemy from <hi>Auximum</hi> might at their backs infeſt them, and ſpoile the <hi>Romans</hi> inhabiting thoſe parts. And likewiſe of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiged in <hi>Ariminum,</hi> they were affraid they might be diſtreſſed for want of Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. Moſt of the Captaines offended with <hi>John,</hi> charged him in their ſpeeches for run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into that danger raſhly, and to get money, and for croſſing (contrary to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) the Counſels of <hi>Beliſarius</hi> concerning the War. But <hi>Narſes</hi> (who loved <hi>John</hi> above all men) fearing leaſt <hi>Beliſarius</hi> upon the Captaines ſpeeches might <q>put <hi>Ariminum</hi> in the ſecond place, ſpake thus. Fellow Commanders, you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in things not to be diſcourſed of, and conſult where none reaſonably can be of two Opinions; but where he who never knew the War may chuſe upon the ſudden. When the danger appeares equall, and the damage alike in miſtaking, aboundant conſultation, and much diſcourſe is fit, and ſo to determine the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters propounded. But we deferring to attempt <hi>Auximum</hi> now, ſhall receive no important hurt; for what ſo ſoon can alter our caſe? Whereas if we receive a blow at <hi>Ariminum</hi> (as can no otherwiſe be) we ſhall ruine (a harſh word) our whole power in <hi>Italy.</hi> If <hi>John</hi> have contemned your Commands, excellent <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſarius,</hi> you have it now in your power to puniſh him, by ſaving the Offender, or abandoning him to the Enemy. But take heed you do not puniſh the Emperour and us, for an unwitting Offence of <hi>John.</hi> If the <hi>Goths</hi> take <hi>Ariminum,</hi> they will make Captive a valiant Generall with his Army, and a City of the Emperours obedience. Neither will the miſchiefe ſtop there, but even conſtitute the whole for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of the War. For the Enemy have now much advantage in numbers; but by being often beaten, are become Cowards, their ill Fortune having taken their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence from them. But if in this deſigne they proſper, they will ſoon recover their Spirits; and them diſpute the War with more then equall Courage: Such as eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape difficulties being commonly wiſer, then they who never had misfortunes. Thus <hi>Narſes</hi> ſpake. But a Souldier from <hi>Ariminum</hi> brought Letters to <hi>Beliſarius</hi> from <hi>John,</hi> which were thus; Know, that our Victuall hath long failed us, and we can no longer anſwer the People, nor reſiſt the Enemy;</q> but within ſeven daies
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50471:102"/>muſt ſore againſt our wills yeild the city and our ſelves. We can no longer ſtrive <q>againſt our neceſſities, which will ſufficiently apologize for us, if we ſhall do any thing not ſo honorable.</q> 
                  <hi>Beliſarius</hi> at this was troubled, and full of irreſolution. He was afraid of the beſieged; and he doubted that the Enemy in <hi>Auximum</hi> would fly abroad and burn the towns thereabout without controule; and by watching advantages diſtreſſe his own army, eſpecially if there ſhould be a battell. In the end he left <hi>Aratius</hi> with a thouſand men to incamp by the Sea ſide, 25 miles from <hi>Aux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imum,</hi> and not to ſtir, nor give fight to the Enemy but in their own Defence; By this he hoped that Enemy would lye quiet in <hi>Auximum,</hi> and not infeſt his army, having a camp of <hi>Romans</hi> ſo neer them. He ſent alſo forces by Sea, commanded by <hi>Herodian, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>liaris,</hi> and <hi>Narſes,</hi> Brother to <hi>Aratius,</hi> and the whole in cheif by <hi>Ilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</hi> Whom <hi>Beliſarius</hi> directed to ſail directly for <hi>Ariminum,</hi> and to land not far off from the foot, which ſhould march by the Sea ſhore commanded by <hi>Martinus,</hi> and appointed to wait upon the Fleet; whom he directed being neer the Enemy to light many fires, not proportionable to their ſmall army ſo to give the Enemy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of greater numbers. Himſelf with <hi>Narſes,</hi> and the reſt of the army, marcht by <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbiſalia,</hi> far from the Sea coaſt; a city ſo ruined by <hi>Alaricus,</hi> that nothing remained of the former beauty, but ſome reliques of one Gate, and of the pavement. Here I met with this adventure. When <hi>Jo</hi> came with his army into <hi>P.</hi> the peple were in much confuſion. and the women ſome ſuddenly fled where they could, others were carried away captives. In this place ſome woman, newly delivered of a Child, had left it in ſwathing clouts upon the Ground; whether ſhe ran away, or were taken from it by the Enemy, ſhe never did return, being likely either gone out of <hi>Italy,</hi> or the World. The child lying in that Deſart cryed, and a ſhee Goat perceiving it, pittied it, and having alſo lately brought forth young, came to it and gave it her Teate, guarding the child, that no Dog nor wild beaſt might hurt it. The troubles laſting long in the country, this Infant had long the benefit of this Teat. But the <hi>Picenians</hi> finding the Emperours army was come againſt the Goths only, and not to hurt the Romans, returned to their ſeverall homes. And into <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbiſalia</hi> the women with their husbands coming, and ſeeing the child, could not imagin what it was, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred how it lived: ſuch women as were ſit, offered their breaſts; but the child would not take womans milk, neither would the Goat leave it; but importunatly bleated, and ſeemed to be greived at the womens troubling it, and in a word pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to it her own. So that the women let it alone, and the Goat nurſed it; for which the people called the child <hi>Aegiſthus.</hi> I travelling that way, they brought me to it, and anger'd it to make it cry; the Goat hearing it, being a ſtones caſt off, ran to it bleating, and ſtood over it that none might hurt it, and this is the ſtory of <hi>Aegiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus.</hi>

               <p>BUT <hi>Beliſarius</hi> marcht by the mountaines, reſolving not to come to a direct battell, being much inferiour in numbers, and the Goths deſperate with their miſ-fortunes. But he thought that when they heard of Forces invading on every ſide, they would not reſiſt, but run away; and the gueſt as it fell out. For being upon the Mountaines a dayes journey from <hi>Ariminum,</hi> he lighted upon Goths travelling about buſineſſe; who being ſuddenly ſurprized, could not turne out of the way, but were ſome ſlain by the Romans, and the reſt wounded ran up, and hid them in the rocks: from whence ſeeing the Romans marching many together in narrow paſſages, they judged them far more then they were, and perceiving the Enſign of <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> they knew that he led them.

That they would not have the conqueſt of <hi>Italy</hi> wholly attributed to <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> but <hi>Narſes</hi> to ſhare in it, who had not left his attendance on the Emperours perſon, to eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh with his own dangers the Glory of <hi>Beliſarius;</hi> but by ſhewing his own valour and wiſdome, to grow famous in the world; and that <hi>Beliſarius</hi> without him could do nothing; moſt of the army commanded by him being diſperſed in the places he had taken.</q> All which they reckoned up from <hi>Sicily</hi> to <hi>Picenia.

Fellow commanders, I find not my ſelf to be of the ſame opinion with you concerning this War. You deſpiſe the Enemy, as abſolutely ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued; but I thinke this confidence will bring you into danger; knowing that the Goths have not been beaten through their cowardice, or want of men, but over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratagem'd with counſell and foreſight, and ſo routed. And you in like ſort I fear from ſome falſe opinion may receive a blow, which may undo your ſelves and the Roman affaires. They are more eaſily undone, who are inſolent with ſucceſſes and conceit of victory; then ſuch as having loſt ſome honour, do for the time to come uſe feare and caution towards their Enemies. Careleſneſſe hath ruined many well ſetled, and a ſolicitous labour releived men after miſ-fortunes: the powers of the negligent leſſening of themſelves, but care naturally adding powers, Conſider that <hi>Vitigis</hi> is in <hi>Ravenna</hi> with many thouſands, That <hi>

The Ambaſſadours at the Gates (being not admitted into the Town) uſed many allurements; but the <hi>Goths</hi> preſuming upon the ſtrength of the place, and their aboundance of Proviſions, rejected them and their motions. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> upon this cauſed the Army to gather Poles, and with them to make a Gallery for men, to approach the Gates and Walls under this covert. Some Friends of <hi>Narſes</hi> told him that <hi>Beliſarius</hi> laboured in vain, (<hi>John</hi> having attempted the place when the Garriſon was ſmall, and found it impregnable) therefore he ſhould take in the Emperours Townes in <hi>Emilia.

The men within unſeen by the Enemy brought the ſame on, at which the <hi>Goths</hi> held out their hands, crying for peace.

The <hi>Goths</hi> for a while were in no abſolute wants, and though furniſhed very barely, yet they indured beyond expectation, having not Food to ſatisfie, but to keep alive only; and their Proviſions being failed, they fed upon Hides, and Skins ſoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in water, and upon vain hopes, which <hi>Albilas</hi> their Commander gave them, a man of great Reputation with the <hi>Goths.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Summer being come, the Corn in all thoſe parts grew of it ſelfe, but not in ſuch quantity as formerly; being not covered under Furrowes by the Plow and Harrow; but lying upon the Face of the Land, which could yeild ſo but ſmall Crop: And none being to reap it, much ſhed, and never grew again. The ſame happened in <hi>Emilia,</hi> that the Inhabitants went all into <hi>Picenia,</hi> which being up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sea, they thought the Famine not to be ſo much there: Which ſeiſed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo upon <hi>Tuſcany;</hi> but there the Mountainers grinded Acornes, and made bread, which bred all kind of Diſeaſes in many; but ſome recovered and lived. But in <hi>Picenia</hi> 50000. <hi>Roman</hi> Husbandmen at leaſt periſhed, and more on this ſide the <hi>Jonian</hi> Gulfe. I have ſeen their Countenances, and manner of deaths. They grew lanck, and pale, the Fleſh wanting Food (according to the old ſaying) feeding on it ſelfe; Choler prevailing ſpred a wan Complexion over their Bodies: And as the Diſeaſe grew, all moiſture forſook them; the Skin was hard like a tanned Hide, and lookt as if it cleft to the bones; afterwards they became black-coloured, and like Lincks much burnt. Their Countenance were hideous, like mad-men; and as moſt dyed for want of Suſtenance, ſo ſome with greedy feeding: whoſe heat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quenched within, if they were nouriſhed to ſatisfaction, and not by little, and little, like Babes new born, being not able to digeſt the meat, they dyed. Some for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Famine fed upon one another. Two Women in a Village beyond. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum</hi> were reported to have eaten 17. men, they onely were left alive in the place, and ſo Paſſengers lodged in their Cottage, whom they killed ſleeping, and eat them. As they were attempting the like upon the 18. he waked, and finding out the truth, killed them both. Many being pincht with this Famine, went where there was Graſſe, and ſtooping to gather it, but being not ſtrong enough to pull it up, they fell upon their hands, and dyed with the Graſſe in their mouths. None buried any, nor had the leaſt thought of Funeralls: The very ravenous Fowles, that feed on dead bodies, would not touch them, there being no fleſh left to allure them, which the Famine had conſumed all. So grievous was that Famine.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Beliſarius</hi> ſent <hi>Martinus</hi> and <hi>

Which <hi>Mundilas</hi> underſtanding, ſent one <hi>Paulus</hi> a Roman to them; who ſlipt by the Enemy and finding no Boats upon the <hi>Poe</hi> ſtript himſelfe,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50471:104"/>and in great danger ſwam over the River. Coming to the <hi>Roman</hi> Campe he told the <q>Commanders <hi>Martinus</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>liaris,</hi> that they did unjuſtly, and not befitting their reputations, to come there in pretence to ſerve the Emperour, but in effect to augment the <hi>Goths</hi> power. That <hi>Millan,</hi> the cheife of the <hi>Italian</hi> Cities for big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, wealth, and populouſneſſe, being a Bulwark for the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Empire againſt the <hi>Germans,</hi> and other <hi>Barbarians,</hi> is now in perill with <hi>Mundilas</hi> and the Emperours Forces, and yet by them neglected. The wrong they did the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, he would forbeare to aggravate, time not allowing many words, but demanding ſpeedy ſuccour, whilſt yet ſome hope is left. That therefore they muſt inſtantly releive <hi>Millan;</hi> if they delayed it, Our fortunes (quoth he) will be after the bittereſt ſufferings to periſh, and yours, to betray the Emperours Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to the Enemy.. Seeing ſuch are juſtly ſayd to betray, not onely who open their Gates to an Enemy, but who having meanes to reſcue their beſt Freinds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiged, by preferring a backward ſecurity before hazarding, abandon them to the Enemy.</q> 
                  <hi>Paulus</hi> ſpake in that ſort, and <hi>Martinus</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>liaris</hi> promiſed him to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low immediately, and ſo ſent him away; who entred <hi>Millan</hi> by night, revived the Souldiers and other <hi>Romans,</hi> and made them yet more cheerfull in their Faith to the Emperour.</p>

               <p>BUT ſtill the Troops with <hi>Martinus</hi> were backward, and lay ſtill, and ſo continued long. <hi>Martinus</hi> to put the blame from himſelfe, wrote thus to <hi>Beliſarius:</hi>
                  <q>You ſent us out to releive our diſtreſſed Freinds in <hi>Millan:</hi> we have uſed our beſt diligence, and are as farr as the River of <hi>Poe;</hi> which the Army feares to paſſe, hearing that in <hi>Liguria</hi> is a great Army of <hi>Goths,</hi> and a multitude of <hi>Burgundians;</hi> with whom we conceive our ſelves not able to fight. Command therefore <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Juſtinus</hi> (who are our neighbours in <hi>Emilia</hi>) to joyne their Troops with us in this adventure; whereby we ſhall be ſafe our ſelves, and doe ſome hurt to the Enemy.</q>
                  <hi>Beliſarius</hi> upon receite of this Letter, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Juſtinus</hi> immediately to joyne with <hi>Martinus</hi> for <hi>Millan.</hi> They refuſed, unleſſe <hi>Narſes</hi> directed them; whereupon <hi>Beliſarius</hi> wrote thus to <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:</hi>
                  <q>Conſider how the Emperours Army is one body: If (as members in bodies) you be not all of a minde, but will be doing one without anothers concurrence; in the end (having done nothing you ſhould) you will all periſh.

But thoſe, and <hi>Martinus</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>liaris</hi> marching to <hi>Millan,</hi> in likely hood will beat the <hi>Goths,</hi>
                  </q> and then againe ſubdue <hi>Emilia,</hi> none being to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them. <hi>Narſes</hi> after peruſall of this Letter, wrote to <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Juſtinus</hi> to march to <hi>Millan</hi> accordingly. <hi>John</hi> afterwards was ſent to the Sea-coaſt, to get Barks for tranſporting the Army over the <hi>Poe;</hi> but a ſickneſſe hindred his buſineſſe. In the mean time of this backwardneſſe of <hi>Martinus</hi> Troops, and <hi>Johns</hi> ſtaying for <hi>Narſes</hi> his Orders, the Beſieged became infinitely diſtreſſed with Famine. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity conſtrained them to feed on Dogs, Rats, Mice, and ſuch uncouth creatures. The <hi>Goths</hi> ſent to <hi>Mundilas</hi> to render the City, offering Indempnity to himſelfe, and the Souldiers. He accepted, ſo they would give aſſurances of performance, and not uſe hard meaſure to the Inhabitants. When the Enemy had given aſſurances to <hi>Mundilas</hi> and the Souldiers, but being angry with the <hi>Ligurians,</hi> appeared reſolved to deſtroy them; he called the Souldiers and ſpake thus. If ever men have choſen <q>to dye honourably when they might have lived baſely, ſuch would I have you now to be, and not for love of breath to live in diſgrace; the rather being of the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50471:105"/>Schoole of <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> where you have learnt ſo plentifully, that it were impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous not to be generous, and extreamly daring. To all men that come into this light, one fate is appointed, in their due time to dye. But in the manner of their deaths men are diſtinguiſhed; Cowards firſt becoming the ſcorn and laughter of their Foes, fulfill their deſtiny too in their defined times. But generous men ſuffer the ſame with Virtue, and an advantage of Honour. If by becoming Slaves to the <hi>Barbarians</hi> we could preſerve this People, our baſe preſervation would have an excuſe; but for us to behold ſo many <hi>Romans</hi> deſtroyed by the Enemy, is more bitter then any death; for we ſhall ſeem even to have helpt the <hi>Goths</hi> to act this Calamity. Whilſt therefore we are yet Maſters of our ſelves, and can beare neceſſity with Virtue, let us make this our hard Fortune, our Glory. My Opinion is, to arme our ſelves compleatly, and to ſally upon the Enemy not looking for us: We ſhall gain one of theſe two; either Fortune to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for us, or elſe an honourable riddance of our miſeries, by a happy death beyond our hopes.</q> The Souldiers for all theſe words of <hi>Mundilas</hi> would not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, but yeilded themſelves and the City upon the Conditions offered. Them the <hi>Goths</hi> hurt not, but made Priſoners with <hi>Mundilas,</hi> but the City they demoliſht to the Ground, killing men of all ages, 300000. at leaſt. The Women they made Slaves, and gave to the <hi>Burgundians,</hi> to gratifie their joyning with them.

                  <hi>BEliſarius</hi> himſelfe with eleven thouſand men came before <hi>Auximum;</hi> which is the Metropolis of <hi>Picenia.</hi> It ſtands ten miles and a halfe from the ſhore of the <hi>Jonian</hi> Gulfe, and from <hi>Ravenna</hi> three dayes journey, and ten miles more, upon a high Hill, with no entrance in any plaine ground, and ſo not approachable by an Enemy. <hi>Vitigis</hi> had Garriſoned in it the choiſeſt <hi>Goths,</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that the <hi>Romans,</hi> miſſing this Towne, would not dare to invade <hi>Ravenna. Beliſarius</hi> encamped his Army round about the bottome of the Hill, divided and lodged in ſeverall quarters. The <hi>Goths</hi> ſeeing them thus ſevered, and not likely in a great Campagnia to ſuccour one another, charged them about evening from the Eaſt ſide of the Towne, where <hi>Beliſarius</hi> Quarter was with his Lanciers and Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getiers: who oppoſed the Invaders, and ſoon routed them; and purſuing got up to the midſt of the Hill; where the <hi>Barbarians</hi> truſting to the advantage of the place, turned head againſt them, killed many, ſhooting upon their heads, till the night prevented them. The day before this skirmiſh, ſome <hi>Goths</hi> being ſent out ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to get Proviſions, were returning by night; and ſeeing the <hi>Romans</hi> fires, ſtood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed. Many adventured and got into <hi>Auximum</hi> unſeen by the <hi>Romans,</hi> others of them hid themſelves in the Woods, thinking to goe to <hi>Ravenna,</hi> but were ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and all cut in peices. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> finding <hi>Auximum</hi> ſtrong, and no meanes to aſſault it, deſpaired to take it by force, but hoped by a cloſe Siege to reduce them to wants, and in time to ſubdue them. The ſtore of Graſſe neer the Walls was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of dayly skirmiſhes: The <hi>Romans</hi> ſeeing the <hi>Goths</hi> cut the ſame for their Horſes, ran up the Hill, fought with them gallantly ſtill, hindred their carrying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Graſſe, and killed many of them. The <hi>Barbarians</hi> overmatcht by their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies valour, did thus. They took the Wheels and Axeltrees off their Waggons, and (their men beginning to cut Graſſe) they rolled them downe upon the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> when they were aſcended the middle of the Hill; but they went to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50471:106"/>without touching a man. The <hi>Goths</hi> failing herein, ran into the Towne. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward they layd an ambuſh of their beſt men in Vallies neer the town; then ſome few appeared about the Graſſe plot, and when the fight was come to Sword and Lance, they roſe from their ambuſh, and having the advantage much in numbers, and amazing the Romans being unlookt for, they, killed many, and put the reſt to flight. The Romans in the quarters ſaw the Enemy riſe from their ambuſh, and cryed loud to their companions to retire, but were not heard, being divided from them the whole length of the hill, and the Barbarians claſhing their armes to drown their cryes. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> was troubled at it, and <hi>Procopius,</hi> the writer of this Hiſtory, came to him, and ſayd. <q>Noble Generall, Anciently the Roman Trumpeters were skilfull in two tunes, one compoſed to incourage the Souldiers to fight, the other to ſound a retreat, when the Generall ſaw his time: Who by this means ſignified his pleaſure, and the Souldiers put it in Execution. For in a battell to doe it by ſhouting is impoſſible; the fright of it amazing, and the claſhing of armes over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the noiſe. But now rudeneſſe hath bereſt us of this skill, and we cannot ſignifie both with one Trumpet: wherefore do you thus. Let the horſemens trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets incourage the Souldiers to fight, and let thoſe of the foot call them to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat; they cannot but diſtinguiſh the ſound, the one being made of Leather, and very thin wood, and the other of a thick peice of Braſſe. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> liked <hi>Procopius</hi> adviſe, and calling the army, ſpake thus.</q> 
                  <q>Courage and forwardneſſe is expedient and commendable ſo far as it is moderate, and hurts not them who uſe it; all things becoming ever worſe with Exceſſe. Commit therefore no more of theſe Errors through vain ambition; to fly ſometime is no ſhame, and who unadviſedly runs into evident miſcheif, if he chance to eſcape, yet is he guilty of Folly. The gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant man is he, that fights valiantly in time of need. The Goths now unable to fight with you, indeavour to ruin you with ambuſhes; and you are more to be blamed for ſtanding the danger, then if you had run out of their ambuſh; nothing being baſer, then to ſerve an Enemies Counſells. I will be carefull to prevent your falling into ambuſhes; and you, when I give the ſignall, preſently retire, which ſhall be done by the ſound of the foot Trumpets.</q> The Souldiers after this ſpeech, ſeeing the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my at the Graſſe, went towards them, and at firſt killed ſome. A <hi>Moore</hi> eſpying one of them with Gold Ornaments, ook him by the hair, and drew him aſide to ſtrip him; but a Goth hit him through both the calves of his legs with a dart, and ſo fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered them both together, yet ſtill he drew the dead body, holding, it by the Hair. In this inſtant the Goths roſe from their ambuſh, and immediatly <hi>Beliſarius</hi> ſeeing all from the camp, cauſed the foot Trumpets to ſound, which the Romans hearing, retired gently, taking up the <hi>Moore</hi> with the Dart through his leggs. The Goths durſt not follow them, but retired too. Afterward the Goths conſidered how they might advertiſe <hi>Vitigis</hi> of their wants, which grew great, and none adventuring to go, as thinking it impoſſible to ſlip by the Enemy, they obſerved a night without moon light, and preparing their men with Letters to <hi>Vitigis,</hi> when the night was far ſpent, they made great cries upon the walls, as if they were in ſome terrible confuſion, preſt by Enemies, and their town ſuddenly taken. The Romans could not imagine the cauſe, and kept within their quarters by <hi>Beliſarius's</hi> direction, fearing a ſurprize from the Town, and from ſome army from <hi>Ravenna,</hi> which might be come to the Enemies ſuccour; and ſo thought better to lye ſtill in a ſafe place, then in a dark night to run into danger: Whereby the Goths ſent out their men uneſpied to <hi>Ravenna;</hi> who the third day, without meeting Enemy, delivered the Letters to <hi>Vitigis,</hi> to this Effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>When your Majeſty placed us in <hi>Auximum,</hi> you ſaid, that in our hands you left the keyes of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> and of your Kingdom, and you therefore ſummoned our uttermoſt power to conſerve the dominion of the Goths, and if we needed it, you promiſed to come to us unſent for with your whole army. We have fought with Famin and <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> and been faithfull Guards of your Kingdome; but you have not thought meet to ſuccour us at all. Think if the Romans take <hi>Auximum,</hi> and the keyes which lye here by you forgotten, whether they will be kept out of any thing you have.</q> 
                  <hi>Vitigis,</hi> upon peruſall hereof, promiſed forthwith to ſuccour <hi>Auximum</hi> with his whole forces, and difmiſt the men: But upon better conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he lay ſtill, doubting leaſt the troops with <hi>John</hi> might fall upon his back, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50471:106"/>him fearing a great power of reſolute men with <hi>Beliſarius;</hi> but principally want of victuall troubled him, not knowing from whence to furniſh his army, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the Romans were maſters of the Sea, and tranſporting their proviſions from <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Calabria,</hi> to the Caſtle of <hi>Ancona,</hi> from thence had it brought with caſe in the due ſeaſon; but the Goths in <hi>Picenia</hi> ſhould have no means of ſupply. But the Meſſengers came ſafe to <hi>Auximum</hi> with <hi>Vitigis</hi> promiſe, which raiſed them with vain hope. And <hi>Beliſarius</hi> hearing thereof, cauſed the Guards to be more ſtrictly kept.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Juſtinus,</hi> beſieging <hi>Faeſulae,</hi> could not approach to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault the place; and the Goths willing rather to end it by fights, then to indure the want of victuall, ſallied often. At firſt the fights were equall, in the end the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans being too hard for them, ſhut them within their walls; keeping exact watch that none might get out. In <hi>Auximum</hi> the Goths perplexed with their wants, ſent out again to <hi>Vitigis</hi> for ſuccour, as unable to hold out any longer. He directed <hi>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>raeas</hi> went into <hi>Picenia</hi> accordingly, with the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with him; paſs't the <hi>Poe,</hi> and came neer the Romans Camp. and ſate down about 7 miles diſtant from them. They began no fights, the Romans thinking it enough to keep them from joyning with the beſieged. And the <hi>Goths</hi> were afraid to fight, conſidering if they ſhould loſe the battell, they ſhould ruin all; being to have no more means of joyning with <hi>Vitigis,</hi> and with him of oppoſing the Enemy: with there counſells they both lay ſtill.</p>

               <p>IN the mean time the Francks hearing how both the Goths and Romans were waſted with this war, conceived it eaſy to get a good ſhare of <hi>Italy,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pined to ſit idle thus, and look upon others, diſputing a province ſo neer neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring.

The reſt were foot men, without bowes or Lances, only wearing a ſword, a ſheild, and a battell axe; the iron where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was broad and ſharp on both ſides, and the handle very ſhort; This upon a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall at the firſt charge they throw from them, to break the Enemies ſheilds and kill them. Thus the Francks, paſſing the <hi>Alpes</hi> which divide <hi>Gaule</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> came into <hi>Liguria.</hi> The Goths were before angry for their not accepting their offers of a large country, and great ſummes to aid them; but now hearing <hi>Theodebert</hi> was come with a mighty army they rejoyced; and hoped to beat their Enemy now without ſtriking ſtroake. And the Francks, while they were in <hi>Liguria,</hi> hurt not the Goths, that they might find no impediment in their paſſage over the <hi>Poe;</hi> and at a Town in <hi>Picenia,</hi> where was an ancient bridge over the River, the Garriſon ſupplyed them, and let them at their pleaſure paſſe the <hi>Poe.</hi> But the Francks being maſters of the Bridge, ſuch women and children as they found, they ſacrificed, and threw into the River as the firſt ſpoiles of the War,<note n="†" place="margin">It ſeems they had Almans with them yet Heathen.

                  </note> retaining yet (though Chriſtians) much of the old religion, &amp; uſing ſacrifices, and other ungodly Rites in making their predictions. The Goths ſeeing it, in a great fear fled into the town, and the Francks being paſt, marcht towards the Goths Camp: Who at firſt ſeeing them in ſmall troops, were glad of their coming, thinking it to be to aid them. But when numbers came on, and fell to the buſineſſe, and darting their Battle axes hurt many, they turn'd about, and ran away by the Romans camp into <hi>Ravenna.</hi> The Romans ſeeing them flye, thought that <hi>Beliſarius</hi> had vanquiſht them in fight, and taken their camp from them; and they took armes, thinking to joyne with him in the purſuit; but they found an Enemy unlook't for, and unwillingly they fought, till being beaten, and not able to return to their camp, they fled into <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> and ſent Newes of the accident to <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſarius.</hi> The <hi>Francks</hi> having conquered both parts, and taken their Camps without any men in them; there then found their proviſions. But in a while they had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50471:107"/>to feed on in a waſted Country, but Oxen, and water of the <hi>Poe,</hi> no bread at all, and being not able to diſgeſt the fleſh, and abundance of water, they fel into flux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and dyſenteries, which they could not get cured for want of things convenient: So that a third part of them are ſaid to have ſo periſht, and being not able to march on, they ſtaid there. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> hearing of this army of <hi>Francks,</hi> and how the troops of <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Martinus</hi> were routed, he was afraid of his army, eſpecially of thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Faeſulae,</hi> who were neereſt the Barbarians, and he wrote this Letter to <hi>Theodebert.</hi>
                  <q>Noble <hi>Theodebert,</hi> for one pretending to virtue, and eſpecially being a King of ſo great a Nation, not to be true of his word, is not Princely; but to violate oaths and accords reduced into writing, is not fit for the meaneſt man. Herein you know your ſelf a Tranſgreſſor; having lately agreed to joyne with us againſt the Goths; &amp; now not ſo much as continuing neutrall, but adviſedly having taken armes, and ſet upon us. Put not this affront upon the Emperour, Good Sr. who will revenge it in the higheſt kind. It is better for a man to hold his own ſecurely, then by medling with what belongs not to him, to run a danger in that which moſt concernes him.</q> 
                  <hi>Theodebert</hi> upon this Letter, and being troubled with his preſent Eſtate, and reviled by the Germans for letting them dy thus in a deſart country to no purpoſe, roſe with the Francks ſurviving, and made haſte home.</p>

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50471:107"/>with like hopes. The <hi>Romans</hi> alſo were weary of this long Siege in a barren deſert Countrey, and troubled to ſee the <hi>Goths</hi> not to yeild, though in ſo much miſery. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> therefore ſought to take ſome Enemy alive, from whom he might learne the ground of this obſtinacy of the <hi>Goths. Valerianus</hi> promiſed to ſerve him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; who had in his Troops <hi>Slavonians,</hi> that uſed to lye under ſome Stone or Buſh, and to ſteale Enemies; a thing ordinarily practiſed by them by the River <hi>Iſter,</hi> where their dwellings are, both upon <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Barbarians. Beliſarius</hi> liking his way, and committing it to his care, he choſe out a <hi>Slavonian,</hi> a tall luſty fellow, and valiant, and aſſured him a good reward from <hi>Beliſarius</hi> to get an Enemy alive; and told him, That at the Graſſe plat, which the <hi>Goths</hi> uſed to eat for want of food, he might doe it with eaſe. The <hi>Slavonian</hi> before day-breake, put himſelfe neer the Towne walls, concealed in a Buſh, and gathering up his feet cloſe about him.

               <p>THere was a Spring-head to the North-ward of <hi>Auximum,</hi> in a craggy ground, a ſtones caſt from the Town, ſending a ſmall ſtream into a Ciſtern anciently there built, which being filled from that ſmall ſtream, ſupplyed water for the Citizens. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> thought that if the water were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the Ciſtern, the <hi>Goths</hi> being plyed with Arrowes, would be long filling their Veſſels from ſo ſmall a ſtream. To ſpoile this Ciſtern, he did thus; he put his Forces in Armes, and in their orders round about the Town, as if he would make a generall Aſſault; The <hi>Goths</hi> fearing the ſame, ſtood upon the Battlements, to oppoſe the Enemy. In the mean time <hi>Beliſarius</hi> brought to the Ciſtern five <hi>Iſau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> covered under a multitude of Shields, skilfull in Maſonry, with Axes, and other Inſtruments to cut ſtones, commanding them to break down the ſides of the Ciſtern. The <hi>Goths</hi> thinking they came to approach the Walls, kept quiet; that being neerer they might ſhoot at them with more advantage, not imagining the buſineſſe. But ſeeing the <hi>Iſaurians</hi> within the Ciſtern, they plyed them with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, and ſtones; The reſt ran back, and the five <hi>Iſaurians</hi> being under in ſafety, fell to work; there being an Arch over the water for ſhade, under which they made no account of the Enemies ſhot, though it came thick. The <hi>Goths</hi> opening the Gate there, ſallied furiouſly upon the <hi>Iſaurians,</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> encountred them, where was a hot fight long, and body to body, and much ſlaughter on both ſides. The <hi>Romans</hi> fell thicker, the <hi>Goths</hi> having the advantage of the upper ground; but the <hi>Romans</hi> gave not back, <hi>Beliſarius</hi> being preſent, and with loud ſhouts en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging them: When from the Enemy came an Arrow whizzing towards the Generals belly, whether ſhot by chance, or purpoſely: <hi>Beliſarius</hi> ſeeing it not, could not ward nor ſhun it; but <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nigatus,</hi> one of his Life-guard, perceiving the Arrow coming almoſt to his belly, put his right hand between, and ſaved the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals life; and being himſelfe wounded with it, and in extremity of pain, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired: His Sinewes were afterwards cut aſunder, and he loſt the uſe of his hand. The Fight beginning in the morning ended at noon, where ſeven <hi>Armenians</hi> of the Troops of <hi>Narſes,</hi> and <hi>Aratius,</hi> ſhewed great deeds of Valour; running up the ſteep Hill, and upon the plain killed all that ſtood them, untill they had routed the <hi>Goths</hi> in that part. And the <hi>Romans</hi> ſeeing the Enemy give ground, fell to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50471:108"/>and the Defeat being cleer, the <hi>Goths</hi> got within their Walls. The <hi>Romans</hi> thought the Ciſtern to be downe, and the <hi>Iſaurians</hi> to have diſpatcht their work; but they could not force one ſtone out of it. The ancient Artiſts, above all, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of their Credits, had ſo wrought this building, that it would not yeild to time, nor the attemps of men; wherefore the <hi>Iſaurians,</hi> ſeeing the <hi>Romans</hi> maſters of the Feild, came out of the Ciſtern, and retired to the Camp. Hereupon <hi>Beliſarius</hi> cauſed the Souldiers to throw dead bodies of Beaſts, and poyſonous Herbs into the water, and to quench burning Lime in it; that the Goths having but one Well within the Walls, with little water in it, were much ſcanted. Neither did <hi>Beliſarius</hi> uſe any more force or deſignes againſt the Town, hoping by Famine only to have his will of the Enemy; and therefore he attended earneſtly to his Guards and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinels. The <hi>Goths</hi> alſo in their great wants were quiet, expecting an Army from <hi>Ravenna.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Faeſulae</hi> the Beſeiged endured fore Famine, and much miſery, and having no hope from <hi>Ravenna,</hi> they reſolved to yeild: And coming to a Parly with <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Juſtinus,</hi> and taking aſſurance for their lives, they rendred themſelves and the Caſtle. <hi>Cyprian</hi> brought them and the <hi>Roman</hi> Army before <hi>Auximum,</hi> leaving a Garriſon in <hi>Faeſulae. Beliſarius</hi> ſhewed their Leaders to the <hi>Goths</hi> in <hi>Auximum,</hi> bidding them leave their Opiniativeneſſe, and hopes from <hi>Ravenna,</hi> from whence receiving no good, but being more ruined daily, they will at laſt come to the ſame Fortune with thoſe of <hi>Faeſulae.</hi> They conſidered of it, and being unable to hold out longer againſt the Famine, they embraced the Propoſition, and rendred the City upon conditions of indemnity to themſelves, and to go with their Goods to <hi>Ravenna. Beliſarius</hi> was in ſome doubt to ſuffer ſo many brave men to joyne with thoſe in <hi>Ravenna;</hi> but he would not loſe the opportunity of marching thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt <hi>Vitigis,</hi> while Affaires was yet in ſuſpence, and the <hi>Francks</hi> expected to come with ſuccours to the <hi>Goths;</hi> whoſe coming though he would willingly prevent, yet he would not raiſe the Seige of <hi>Auximum,</hi> before it were, taken. But the Souldiers oppoſed the <hi>Goths</hi> having their Goods, ſhewing their wounds, and recounting their toiles in the Seige, whereof they alledged the ſpoiles of the Conquered to be the due Prizes. In the end forced by the preſſing opportunity, and the <hi>Goths</hi> compelled by the Famine, they came to this accord; That the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> ſhould have halfe the Goods, and the <hi>Goths</hi> with the other halfe he ſubject to the Emperour: And upon this they gave Oath, the <hi>Roman</hi> Commanders to obſerve the Agreement, and the <hi>Goths</hi> not to conceale any of their Goods. So they ſhared the Goods, and the <hi>Romans</hi> had <hi>Auximum,</hi> and the <hi>Goths</hi> were mingled with the Army.</p>

                  <hi>BEliſarius</hi> having taken <hi>Auximum,</hi> made haſt to <hi>Ravenna</hi> with his whole Army; He ſent <hi>Magnus</hi> before with competent numbers, to skirt the Bancks of <hi>Poe,</hi> and prevent the tranſporting of Proviſions into <hi>Ravenna</hi> that way. <hi>Vitalius,</hi> being come out of <hi>Dalmatia</hi> with Forces, guarded the other ſide of the River; a Fortune here befell, which ſhewed evidently, that ſhe it is who will determine the controverſie.

And now the <hi>Goths</hi> began to be ſcarce of Proviſions, importing nothing from the <hi>Jonian</hi> Gulfe (by reaſon the Enemy was Maſter of the Sea) and the River be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blockt up.</p>
               <p>The Kings of the <hi>Francks</hi> underſtanding how things went, and deſiring to put for <hi>Italy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> ſent Ambaſſadours to <hi>Vitigis</hi> with offers of aides, ſo they might ſhare the Dominion of the Country with him; which <hi>Beliſarius</hi> being advertiſed of, ſent alſo Ambaſſadours to diſpute it with the <hi>Francks,</hi> and among others, <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius</hi>

The <hi>Francks</hi> Ambaſſadours were firſt heard, and ſpake thus: <q>The Kings of the <hi>Francks</hi> have ſent us hither, ſorry to heare that you are diſtreſſed by <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> and ready according to their League to avenge you. There is an Army paſſed the <hi>Alpes,</hi> of 500000. men, who at their very firſt Encounter will over-whelme the <hi>Roman</hi> Army with their battle Axes. Hearken not therefore to their Counſell, who would make you Slaves, but to theirs ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who in their Affection to you embrace the hazards of a War; And the rather, becauſe joyning with us, the <hi>Romans</hi> cannot hope to match both our powers, but we ſhall with eaſe have the Victory. Whereas if you joyne with the <hi>Romans,</hi> yet ſhall they not be able to ſtand againſt the <hi>Francks,</hi> (the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell even then being not to be with equall powers) and you will be vanquiſhed in the company of your greateſt Foes. To run therefore into ſo evident miſchiefe, having meanes to be preſerved without hazard, is extreameſt folly. The <hi>Romans</hi> are not faithfull to any <hi>Barbarians,</hi> but naturally Enemies to them. But we (if you like it) will ſhare with you the Dominion of <hi>Italy,</hi> and divide the Country as we ſhall both think beſt. Make choice therefore of what is moſt expedient for you. The <hi>Francks</hi> having done, the Ambaſſadours of <hi>Beliſarius</hi> ſpake thus: That the <hi>Francks</hi> multitudes ſhall not hurt the Emperours Army, as theſe men would fright us, what needs a long Speech to you, whoſe experience hath learnt all the moments of War? and that Valour is not vanquiſht with multitudes. The Emperour can more then any, (if he pleaſe) exceed his Enemy in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. The faithfulneſſe of theſe men to all <hi>Barbarians,</hi> we know, and themſelves have ſhewed it to the <hi>Thuringians, Burgundians,</hi> and to you their Allies: So that we would gladly ask, by what God they mean to ſweare for the pledge of their Faith. How they have reſpected him by whom they have already ſworn, you know; who coming as Friends to aide you, did not only not joyne in the danger, but impudently took Armes againſt you; if you remember what they did at the <hi>Poe.</hi> What need we, by repeating things paſt, convince the <hi>Francks</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety? Can any thing be more deteſtable then this their Ambaſſage? as if they had forgotten former Treaties; now they pretend their aides to be better then other mens; but if they obtain the <hi>Goths</hi> to mingle with their Armies once, what will be the period or their inſatiable deſires, were good to conſider.</q> 
                  <hi>Beliſarius</hi> Ambaſſadours having thus ſpoken, <hi>Vitigis</hi> after long conference with the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall <hi>Goths,</hi> choſe an Accord with the Emperour, and diſmiſt the <hi>Francks</hi> with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyall.</p>
               <p>From hence forward the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Goths</hi> ſent Ambaſſadours to each other: But ſtill <hi>Beliſarius</hi> ſet Guards to hinder importation of Proviſions; and he employed <hi>Vitalius</hi> to take in Townes in <hi>Venetia,</hi> and himſelfe with <hi>Ildeger</hi> guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded both ſides of the <hi>Poe,</hi> to draw thus the Goths to yeild to him upon his own tearmes for want of Victuall. Hearing how there was much Corn in the publick Magazines of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> he won a Citizen with money to ſet them all on fire; which loſſe (ſome ſay) happened by <hi>Mattaſuntha's</hi> adviſe, the Wife of <hi>Vitigis.</hi> It was ſo ſuddenly done, that ſome thought it was by lightning, as others by deſigne, and <hi>Vitigis</hi> and the Goths taking it in either kind, fell into more irreſolution, neither truſting one another, and thinking God himſelfe made War againſt them.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Alpes</hi> alſo which divide <hi>Gaule</hi> and <hi>Liguria,</hi> (called <hi>Alpes Cottiae</hi>) are many Caſtles, whereof many principall Goths have the Guard, having long dwelt there with their wives and children. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> deſirous to reduce them, ſent <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> thither, one of his retinue, with ſome few, to give Faith, and receive the Goths upon compoſition, whom <hi>Siſigis</hi> commander of all thoſe Garriſons received into a Caſtle, and with himſelf brought in all the reſt.

               <p>IN the mean time, <hi>Beliſarius</hi> ſhut up in <hi>Ravenna, Vitigis,</hi> and the cheife of the Goths: and the Emperours Ambaſſadors arrived, <hi>Domnicus</hi> and <hi>Maximinus,</hi> both Senators; with commiſſion to make peace upon Tearms, that <hi>Vitigis</hi> ſhould have half the Revenues of the Crown, and the Dominion of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try beyond the <hi>Poe;</hi> the other half of the Revenues to be the Emperours, and the reſt of <hi>Italy</hi> to be ſubject to him, and to pay him Tribute. The Ambaſſadors ſhewed the Emperours inſtructions to <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> and were conducted into <hi>Ravenna:</hi> And <hi>Vitigis</hi> and the Goths gladly agreed to conclude the treaty upon thoſe condition. This diſcontented <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> as an ill ſervice to hinder him from the abſolute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and his bringing <hi>Vitigis</hi> to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> priſoner, having it in his power: and at the Ambaſſadors return he refuſed to ſigne the Treaty, upon which the Goths were jealous of the Romans that they fraudulently propounded a peace, and proteſted to conclude nothing without the ſignature and oath of <hi>Beliſarius.</hi> Who hearing that ſome Commanders taxed him with a deſign againſt the Emperours ſervice, to prolong the War; he called them all, and in the preſence of <hi>Domnicus</hi> and <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iminus</hi> ſpake thus <q>The fortune of the war (I and you know) ſtands not upon firm Ground; many in hope of an inſtant victory have been overthrown, and an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, in appearance ruined, hath beyond imagination ſubſiſted. So that men conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of peace, are not to fancy the beſt for themſelves only, but to conſider the event both waies in poſſibility, and ſo to reſolve. And I now aſſemble you my fellow Commanders, and the Emperours Ambaſſadors, that chuſing with all free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome what you think moſt expedient for the Emperour, you may not after the buſineſſe done, lay imputations upon me; it being moſt unreaſonable, when you may chuſe the beſt, to be ſilent, and when you ſee the Event, then to coyn accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations. The Emperours reſolution, and <hi>Vitigis</hi> mind for concluding the war, you know; which if you conceive to be expedient, ſay ſo; but if you thinke your ſelves able to recover <hi>Italy,</hi> and to ſubdue the Enemy, there is no danger, boldly to ſay it.</q>
                  <hi>Beliſarius</hi> having ſpoken, they all ſaid plainly that the Emperours in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions were beſt, and that they were not able to do more then they had done. The opinion pleaſed <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> and he bade them expreſſe it in a writing, that they might not deny it afterwards; which they ſigned accordingly; that they were not able to ſubdue the Enemy by war. But the Goths the while preſt with Famin, could hold out no longer; weary they were of <hi>Vitigis</hi> government, and yet ſcrupulous to yeild to the Emperour; fearing to be removed by him out of <hi>Italy</hi> to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and planted thereabout. So that the principall men upon debate reſolved to declare <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſarius</hi> Emperour of the Weſt, and ſecretly they ſent to entreat him to accept the Empire, profeſſing to be moſt willing to obey him. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> would not take the Empire without the Emperours conſent; to whom he was tyed in a ſolemn oath, not to innovat during the ſaid Emperours life; and the very name of an Uſurper he hated: yet to facilitate his buſineſſe, he ſeemed to accept the offer. <hi>Vitigis</hi> perceiving it, out of fear, commended the Goths reſolution, and ſecretly animated <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> that there ſhould be no rub in his way to the Empire. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> hereupon called the Commanders with the Ambaſſadors, and askt them, if they thought it not a matter of importance, to make all the Goths, and <hi>Vitigis</hi> the Emperours Captives; to ſhare their wealth, and to recover all <hi>Italy</hi> to the Romans: They ſaid, it would be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream high fortune, and prayed him to effect it if he could. Preſently <hi>Beliſarius</hi> ſent ſome of his favorites to <hi>Vitigis,</hi> and the cheife Goths, willing them to perform their offer immediatly. Indeed the Famin would not permit a put-off, but brought them to it; that again they ſent Ambaſſadors with the former propoſitions openly, but privatly to take <hi>Beliſarius</hi> oath for their indemnity, and that he would be King of <hi>Italy;</hi> and that done, to return into <hi>Ravenna</hi> with the Roman army. Concerning
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50471:110"/>the reſt <hi>Beliſarius</hi> gave oath; but touching the Kingdome, he ſaid he would ſwear it to <hi>Vitigis</hi> and the Goths Commanders. The Ambaſſadors not thinking he would reject the Kingdome, but that he deſired it above all things, prayed him forthwith to march into <hi>Ravenna. Beliſarius</hi> ſent away <hi>Narſes, Aratius, Beſſas</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> (whom he ſuſpected to be worſt affected to him) to quarter with their Troops in ſeverall countryes, telling them he could not poſſibly bring into that city proviſions for the whole army. They with <hi>Athanaſius, Praefect</hi> of the Palace, lately come from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> went accordingly; &amp; himſelf and the reſt of the army entred <hi>Ravenna,</hi> with the Goths Ambaſſadors. He commanded alſo ſhips he had laded with Corn, to come into <hi>Eſclae</hi> the haven for <hi>Ravenaa.</hi> When I ſaw the entrance of this army into <hi>Ravenna,</hi> I conſidered how actions are not concluded by valour, multitudes, or human virtue; but that ſome ſpirit ſteers the wits and judgments of men thither, where nothing can hinder the pre-ordained concluſion. The Goths had much the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in numbers and power, and ſince they came to <hi>Ravenna</hi> had no battell, nor their courages dejected with any accident, yet they became priſoners, and thought it no ſhame to be ſlaves to fewer in number. The women (who had heard from their Husbands, that the Enemy were tall gallant men, and not to be numbred, ſcorned the Souldiers when they ſaw them in the City, and reviled their husbands cowardice, pointing at their conquerours.</p>

               <p>BUT <hi>Beliſarius</hi> kept <hi>Vitigis</hi> in an honourable reſtraint, and ſent away ſuch Goths as inhabited this ſide the <hi>Poe,</hi> to their own houſes, to poſſeſſe them freely; fearing from thence no hoſtility, nor that the <hi>Goths</hi> would gather head in thoſe parts, becauſe much of the Army was there Garriſon'd.

The beſt Goths are conſumed by the war, and the beſt of the remainder <hi>Beliſarius</hi> is carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, away with all our Treaſures; and no man doubts, but we ſhortly being few, &amp; enemies, ſhal ſuffer the ſame.

                     <hi>Ildebad</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus made King, aſſembled the Goths, and ſpake thus: Fellow Souldiers, we have had experience of many Wars, and in likely-hood ſhall not run raſhly now into this; Experience brings Wit; and wit is never Foole-hardy. It is fit now to conſult of our preſent Eſtate, by calling to mind the former Accidents. Men by an affected forgetfulneſſe of things paſt, and ſo by fooliſhly keeping high thoughts, have been ruined in their greateſt occaſions. <hi>Vitigis,</hi> without your oppoſing him, hath put himſelfe into the Enemies hands; you being tired with croſſe Fortunes, and chuſing rather (quietly ſitting at home) to obey <hi>Beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarius,</hi> then to hazard. But he being going to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> now you reſolve to ſtir; whereas you ſhould conſider, that men ſpeed not alwaies in the way they expect, that often the Event beyond Imagination is contrary to the apparance; Fortune and Repentance commonly doing beſt, unlookt for, which is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, may be now the caſe of <hi>Beliſarius.</hi> Wherefore our beſt way is, to ſend firſt to know his mind, and to perſwade him to what was lately accorded, and ſo to enter into action.</q> This counſell of <hi>Ildebad</hi> they all conceived to be beſt, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſent Ambaſſadours to <hi>Ravenna;</hi> who put <hi>Beliſarius</hi> in mind of his Agreement, blamed his infringing the ſame, and reproached him for not bluſhing to be thus a Voluntary Slave, and to prefer Servitude before a Kingdome. Many ſuch Provocations they uſed, and animated him to accept the Government, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him that <hi>Ildebad</hi> would willingly give place, lay at his feet the Purple Robe, and ſalute him, <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> King of the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Italians.</hi> The Ambaſſadours ſpake thus, thinking that <hi>Beliſarius</hi> would not be ſo ſcrupulous, as to reject the Title of a King. But he, contrary to their expectations, plainly refuſed it, ſaying; that during the <hi>Emperour Juſtinians</hi> life, he would not intrude upon ſuch a Title. They hearing this, inſtantly departed, and reported it to <hi>Ildebad.</hi> And <hi>Beliſarius</hi> took his Journey towards <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the Winter ending, and the fifth yeare of this War, written by <hi>Procopius.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HUS <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> leaving <hi>Italy</hi> yet unſetled, brought <hi>Vitigis</hi> and <hi>Ildebads</hi> children to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> with all the rich ſpoiles; accompanied only with <hi>Ildiger, Valerianus, Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and <hi>Herodian. Juſtinian</hi> was glad to ſee <hi>Vitigis</hi> and his Queen, admiting the <hi>Goths</hi> for their beautifull tall bodies. <hi>Theodericks</hi> treaſures (a goodly ſight to behold) he took in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Palace, and in private expoſed them to the view of the Senate, glorying much in the greatneſſe of the things done. He ſhewed not the ſame to the People, nor allowed <hi>Beliſarius</hi> a triumph, as after his conqueſt of <hi>Gelimer</hi> and the <hi>Vandals.</hi> Yet was <hi>Beliſarius</hi> the diſcourſe of all the world, having gained the honour of two unmatchable victories, brought two Kings Priſoners to <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> and beyond all expectation, made ſpoiles of Warre the race and wealth of <hi>Genſericke,</hi> and <hi>Theoderick,</hi> the moſt illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious of all the <hi>Barbarians.</hi> He brought backe alſo to the <hi>Roman</hi> State their owne wealth from the hands of their Enemies, and in a ſhort time recovered the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of almoſt one halfe of the Land and Seas thereof. It was a delight to the <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolitans</hi> (and they could not be ſatisfied with it) to behold daily <hi>Beliſarius</hi> paſſing from his houſe, and returning thither through the Market-place; His going in the ſtreets being a kind of triumph; multitudes of <hi>Vandales, Goths,</hi> and <hi>Moores</hi> ever fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing him: and he was a beautifull perſonage, tall, and of the goodlieſt counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance that could be ſeen; To ſutors ever eaſie of acceſſe, and milde as the meaneſt man. Both the Souldier, and the Countrey-man were ever infinitely in love with his Government, being to the Souldiers exceeding bountifull; to ſuch as had miſchances in fight, comforting their wounds with large ſummes, and to ſuch as did bravely, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving chaines and bracelets for prizes of honour. If a Souldier in fight, loſt his horſe,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:50471:114"/>or his Bow, or the like, preſently he had another from <hi>Beliſarius.</hi> And he was dear to the Countrey people, becauſe he uſed ſuch good husbandry and providence, that where he was Generall, none ever ſuffered violence, but all where his Armie came had the ſtrange fortune to grow richer; ſelling their commodities to the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier at their owne rates, who guarded ſtill their ripe Corns, to keep off Horſe from ſpoiling them; Neither was any ſuffered to take away their ripe fruits. Beſides he had a wonderfull care of his chaſtity, never touching any woman but his Wife; and of ſo many faire Priſoners of the <hi>Vandales</hi> and the <hi>Goths</hi> (ſuch as none ever ſaw the like) ſuffering not one to be brought into his ſight, nor to come at him. He was of a very ſharp wit, and excellent in a doubtfull caſe to deviſe the beſt way; valiant in Warr with cautiouſneſſe, and bold upon adviſe of reaſon; ever either ſwift or flow in his undertakings upon an Enemy, according to occaſion. In extreamities reſolute, full of hope, and free from perturbation. In proſperity hee was neither exalted, nor voluptuous: No man ever ſaw <hi>Beliſarius</hi> drunck. And thus during his command in <hi>Affrick</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> he was ſtill victorious, and Maſter of all in his way: And when he came home to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> his worth was yet more taken notice of; For being himſelfe eminent in vertue, and exceeding all the Generalls that ever were in wealth, and in the ſtrength of his Lanciers, and Targettiers, he was terrible both to Commanders and common Souldiers. So that no man durſt oppoſe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, but readily put in execution what he directed; both reverencing his worth, and fearing his power. For he had ready of the Retinew of his Houſe 7000. Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, choice men, and every one of them thinking himſelfe fit to ſtand in the firſt ranck at a Battaile, and to challenge the braveſt of the Enemies. The ancient men of <hi>Rome</hi> at that ſiege ſeeing what thoſe men did in the fights then, and taking if for a great wonder, ſaid, That one mans Family ruined the power of <hi>Theoderick.</hi> Thus was <hi>Beliſarius</hi> growen powerfull both in dignity and counſell, ever adviſing the Emperours beſt advantage, and cheerfully executing what was reſolved.</p>
               <p>But the other Commanders (being equall in power, and having no thought but upon their owne private gaine) made ſpoile of the <hi>Roman</hi> Subjects, and expoſed them to the injuries of the Souldier. They apprehended nothing worthy themſelves, nor had the Common ſouldiers obedient to their commands; and ſo commiting many errours, the <hi>Romans</hi> affaires were in a ſhort time ruined; and thus it was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ildebad</hi> hearing that <hi>Beliſarius</hi> was gone from <hi>Ravenna,</hi> and upon his journey, recollected the <hi>Goths,</hi> and ſuch <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers as would revolt; was carefull of the Government, and diligent to recover the Dominion of <hi>Italy.</hi> At firſt he had with him but a thouſand men, and no Towne but <hi>Picenum.</hi> But in a while all who were in <hi>Liguria,</hi> and <hi>Venetia,</hi> came dropping in to him.</p>
               <p>There was in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> one <hi>Alexander,</hi> chiefe Auditor of the publique Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, called <hi>Logothetes</hi> by the <hi>Romans,</hi> from the Greek. This mans practice was to inform againſt Souldiers for wronging the Treaſury; and for ſuch miſdemeanors by bringing them to juſtice, he became of an obſcure man eminent, and of a Beggar very rich. He raiſed as much money for the Emperour as any man; but was the greateſt cauſe that the Soldiers were few &amp; poor, and backward in dangers. At <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> they gave him a nick-name, <hi>Pſalidion,</hi> for the dexterity he had to clip away the ring of the gold coyn; and though he made it leſſe, yet to have it keep the circular form it had at the firſt. The inſtrument wherewith this is done, is called <hi>Pſalidion,</hi> or clipping ſheers. This man the Emperour ſent into <hi>Italy,</hi> when he recalled <hi>

                     </gap>eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarius;</hi> And he in <hi>Ravenna</hi> ſet a foot Audits without reaſon, calling the Italians to accompt, who never toucht the Emperour monies, and ſome that never had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique employment, and charging them with wrong done to <hi>Theodorick,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Gothiſh</hi> Kings, and compelling them to repay what they had robbed, or fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulently gained, as he alleadged. The Souldiers for their wounds and bazards he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited with ſlender accounts; whereby the <hi>Italians</hi> grew ill affected to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and the Souldiers would not engage themſelves into dangers; but turning wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full cowards, advanced the Enemies affaires to a great height.</p>
               <p>All the Commanders ſate ſtill, but <hi>Vitalius,</hi> who had with him in <hi>Venetia</hi> many <hi>Herulians,</hi> and ſome other numbers of the Army; he would fight with <hi>Ilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad,</hi> fearing (what afterward came to paſſe) that his growing power might not ſo eaſily be reſtrained. The Battaile was valiantly fought neer the City of <hi>Tarviſium;</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:50471:114"/>but <hi>Vitalius</hi> had the worſt; and ſuffering the loſſe of moſt of his men, with a few eſcaped by flight. Many <hi>Herulians</hi> fell, and <hi>Viſandus</hi> their Leader. <hi>Theudimund,</hi> the Son of <hi>Mauricius,</hi> the Son of <hi>Mundus,</hi> a young man, was in much danger of being loſt, but eſcaped with <hi>Vitalius.</hi> This Battell made <hi>Ildebad</hi> famous with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and all men; But afterward <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>raeas</hi> fell foule with him, upon this occaſion. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>raas</hi> had a Wife, for Wealth and Beauty, the chiefe of her Nation. She went once to the publick Bath bravely dreſt, and with a goodly Traine; where ſeeing <hi>Ildehads</hi> Wife in a mean Habit, ſhe bowed not to her, as to the Kings Conſort, but ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſcoff'd at her; for as yet her Husband was in a low Condition, as having not been Maſter of any Kingly Revenue. But the Queen vexed with this groſſe Affront, came weeping to her Husband, deſiring him to right her, having ſuffered from <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>raeas</hi> Wife things not to be endured. Whereupon <hi>Ildebad</hi> firſt accuſed <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>raeas</hi> to the Goths, of purpoſing a Revolt; and afterward killed him treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, and was hated for it by the <hi>Goths,</hi> who liked not this killing of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>raas</hi> without Examination; and they gathered together, and railed upon <hi>Ildebad</hi> for this foule Act; yet none of them were willing he ſhould ſuffer for it. One among them, named <hi>Vilas,</hi> by race a <hi>Gepaede,</hi> and a Lancier of the Guard to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, was a Suiter to a very faire Woman, and infinitely doted upon his love. But being ſent upon ſome Service, <hi>Ildebad</hi> the mean while gave his Miſtreſſe to another in marriage; either ignorantly, or upon ſome motive: Which <hi>Vilas</hi> hearing at his coming from the Army, and being naturally impatient, could not beare the diſgrace, but reſolved to kill <hi>Ildebad;</hi> wherein he thought too to gratifie all the <hi>Goths.</hi> He obſerved his time as the King feaſted the chiefe men, when many uſe to ſtand by him, eſpecially his Guards. The King reaching his hand to a diſh, and bowing with his face upon the Couch, <hi>Vilas</hi> ſuddenly ſtrook him with his Sword upon the neck, that the meat being between his fingers, the head fell off, and ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all the Company. Thus was the Murther of <hi>

All the <hi>Goths</hi> were weary of <hi>Eraricks</hi> Government, finding him not capable to make a War with the <hi>Romans;</hi> and they railed on him as a hinderer of many good Deſignes they were ready to act, when they killed <hi>Ildebad.</hi> In concluſion, by common conſent they ſent to <hi>Tarviſium,</hi> exhorting <hi>Totilus</hi> to the Government.

All refuſing the danger, <hi>Artabazes</hi> an <hi>Armenian</hi> chearfully undertook it; a very gallant Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, who was Captain of thoſe <hi>Perſians,</hi> whom <hi>Beliſarius</hi> brought to <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> with <hi>Bliſchames,</hi> after his taking the Caſtle of <hi>Siſaurium.</hi> He ſettled a 100. men of the Army, and late in the night got neer to the Town. The Watch-man o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened the Gate; ſome ſtood ſtill and ſent for the Army, others mounted the Walls and ſlew the Sentinels, coming unexpected: And the <hi>Goths</hi> perceiving the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, ran out at another Gate, and retired to a high Hill over againſt <hi>Verona</hi> (from whence one may diſcern all done in the City, and number the men in the Streets, and it hath a large Proſpect into the Champian) and here they ſtayed all night. The <hi>Romans</hi> being within five miles of the City, would go no further; the Generals diſputing about the Booty of it; and while they were thus brabling for the ſpoiles, the day grew bright. The <hi>Goths</hi> from the Hill diſcovering the Enemy in the Town, and how great a way the Army was from it, ran in at the ſame Gate they ran out; the Romans within being not able to poſſeſſe it: who adviſing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether fled to the Battlements, where the <hi>Goths</hi> in multitudes aſſailed, and they ſtoutly defended, and did wonders; eſpecially <hi>Artabazes.</hi> The <hi>Roman</hi> Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, when they had diſpoſed the Wealth of <hi>Verona</hi> among themſelves, marcht a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Town with the Army. But finding the Gates ſhut, and the Enemy ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſing, they forthwith ran away, though they ſaw their Companions upon the Walls fighting, and calling to them to ſtay for them. So that <hi>Artabazes,</hi> and the reſt being oppreſt with multitudes, and deſpairing of Succour, leapt from the Walls; and himſelfe, with ſuch as lighted upon ſmooth ground, came ſafe to the Camp, but they that fell upon ſtony ground, periſht all. The <hi>Roman</hi> Army paſt the <hi>Poe,</hi> and came to <hi>Faventia,</hi> which is a City of <hi>Emilia,</hi> ſtanding 15. miles from it. <hi>Totilas</hi> when he heard what had happened at <hi>Verona,</hi> ſent for moſt of that Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and with his whole Army being 50000. he marcht againſt the Enemy.

               <p>
                  <q>Fellow Commanders, let us not deſpiſe the Enemy, as inferiour in numbers; nor as being to fight with men cowed by <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> go on with reſolution. Falſe
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50471:115"/>conceits have deceived and undone many, and their unſeaſonable deſpiſing an Enemy diſſolved their Forces.

I ſpeak not this by gueſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e, I have learnt their Courage by mine own late danger. And let none be offended with me for extolling their power, having been with a few with me beaten by them. Mens Valour is ſeen as well when they are more, as when they are fewer then thoſe they fight with. My Opinion therefore is, to guard the paſſage of the River, and when the <hi>Goths</hi> are halfe paſt over, to fight with them rather, then now with their whole body. And let no man think that there is no honour in ſuch a Victory. Honour and diſgrace receive their names from the Event.</q> Men commend the Victors, not ſearching into the manner of the Victory. <hi>Artabazes</hi> ſo ſpake; But the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders contradicting one another, did nothing they ſhould do, but there ſtaid, and did nothing. The <hi>Goths</hi> came neer, and being ready to paſſe the River, <hi>Totilas</hi> ſpake thus unto them. <q>Friends and Country-men; other Battells begin upon the ſhew of equality in the Armies to fight, but we now ſtand to fight, having a Fortune moſt unequall. If they be beaten, they have meanes to fight with us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, having numbers of Souldiers in their Garriſons, all <hi>Italy</hi> over, and expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forthwith the ſeconds of another Army from <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> But if the ſame befall us, the hopes and name of our Nation is loſt; being already from 200000. reduced to 50000. yet is it ſit that you be put in mind, that when you took Armes with <hi>Ildebad</hi> againſt the Emperour, you had but 1000. men together, and no place left but the Town of <hi>Picenum.</hi> But no ſooner were you Conquerours, but your Armies and Townes augmented: And if you now do bravely, I hope (the War proceeding probably) we ſhall vanquiſh the Enemy. It is the Fortune of Conquerours ever to grow in numbers, and power. So that reſolve to meet the Enemy chearfully, and ſtoutly; knowing, that if you get not the honour of this day, you can never poſſibly fight again. Moreover our Enemies Injuſtice is to embolden us in this Battell. The <hi>Italians</hi> ſubject to them they have ſo oppreſt, that they need no other puniſhment for their Treaſon againſt the <hi>Goths:</hi> So (in a word) have they found all manner of miſchiefes from their new Gueſts. Now what is more eaſily caught then an Enemy, who ſtands not ſound with God? Their feare of us alſo may encourage us; we going againſt no other men then thoſe, who being in the midſt of <hi>Verona,</hi> quitted it without reaſon, and ran away ſhamefully, none purſuing them.</q> 
                  <hi>Totilas</hi> having uſed this encouragement, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded 300. men to paſſe the River two miles and a halfe off, and to get behind the Enemy; and (the Fight being begun) to ſhoot at their backs, and being in confuſion to gall them. Himſelfe with the reſt paſt there the River, and went againſt the Enemy. The <hi>Romans</hi> encountred them, and both marching faire and ſoftly, and being neer each other, <hi>Valiaris,</hi> a <hi>Goth,</hi> tall, and of a ſtern Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and very Valiant, rode out from the reſt between the Armies, armed with Corſlet and Helmet, and challenged any <hi>Roman</hi> to fight with him. <hi>Artabazes</hi> accepted the Combate. Both rode againſt each other, and charged their Lances; <hi>Artabazes</hi> preventing, ran <hi>Valiaris</hi> into the left ſide, who having his mortal wound, and ſincking backward, his Lance reſting upon the ground and at a great ſtone, kept him from falling: <hi>Artabazes</hi> with eagerneſſe thruſt his Lance into his belly, not thinking he had his deaths wound already; and the head of <hi>Valiaris</hi> Lance ſtanding upright, lighted upon the Corſlet of <hi>Artabazes,</hi> and gliding over it, peir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his neck, and cut one of the Arteries: He bled inſtantly in abundance, but feeling no pain, gallopt to the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp, and left <hi>Valiaris</hi> dead upon the place. The blood could not be ſtancht, ſo that the third day he dyed, and ſtagger'd all the hopes of the <hi>Romans;</hi> for his being not able to fight in that Battell, was an extream ruine to them. He attending the cure of his Wound without Arrow-ſhot, the Armies joyned Battell; in the heat whereof the 300. <hi>Goths</hi> at the <hi>Romans</hi> backs ſuddenly appeared; the <hi>Romans</hi> thinking them to be great numbers, were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, and ran away in confuſion, with the Enemy at their heels; who took many Priſoners, and all their Enſignes, a thing never before happened to the <hi>Romans.</hi> The Commanders with ſome few ran into ſeverall Townes for ſafety, and guarded the ſame.</p>

Then <hi>John</hi> furiouſly giving upon the Enemy with a great ſhout, one of his life guard was ſlain by a dart, whereupon the Romans retired, beaten back: Then came up the reſt of the Roman army, and in the plain put themſelves in batallion, and made an halte: if they had ſet upon the flying Troops of <hi>John,</hi> and with them ſet upon the Enemy, they had gotten the day, and had them almoſt all at their mercy; but an unlucky rumor was ſpred that <hi>John</hi> was ſlain in the fight by one of his owne Life-Guard, ſo that they would ſtay no longer, but made a ſhamefull retreate, not reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in a whole body, nor yet in Troops; but every man ran away as he could.

With him he ſent a navy, having aboard an army conſiſting of <hi>Thracians</hi> under <hi>Herodian,</hi> and of <hi>Armenians</hi> under <hi>Phazas</hi> an <hi>Iberian,</hi> ſiſters Son of <hi>Peranius,</hi> and ſome few Huns they had with them. <hi>Maximinus</hi> from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> with his Fleet came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:50471:116"/>the coaſt of <hi>Epirus,</hi> where he ſpent the time to no purpoſe, being no Souldier, a coward; and an extream delayer. Afterward the Emperour ſent <hi>Demetrius</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall; who had formerly commanded a company of Foot under <hi>Beliſarius:</hi> He arriving in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and hearing how <hi>Conon</hi> was beſieged in <hi>Naples</hi> and in great want of victuall, had a mind to ſuccour him ſpeedily; but with ſo ſmall an army being not able, be freighted a number of ſhips, (which he got together from all parts of. <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily</hi>) with corn and other proviſions, making the Enemy beleive that he had a great army abroad, who indeed hearing of a huge navy coming from <hi>Sicily,</hi> expected a great army with it. If <hi>Demetrius</hi> had made directly for <hi>Naples,</hi> he had frighted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Enemy and ſaved the city. But he was afraid to put in there, and ſailed on to the port of <hi>Rome,</hi> imploying himſelf there to gather together the Souldiers; Who being already beaten by the Goths, and extreamly afraid of them, refuſed to follow him againſt <hi>Totilas.</hi> So that with thoſe only he brought from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> he went towards <hi>Naples.</hi> Another <hi>Demetrius,</hi> a Cephalenian, an ancient marriner ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry skilfull, when he ſailed with <hi>Beliſarius</hi> into <hi>Affrica</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> grew famous for his skill, and the Emperour made him Procurator of <hi>Naples.</hi> In the beginning of the Goths ſeige there, being a man of a foul intemperate tongue, he uſed many diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full words againſt <hi>Totilas.</hi> the Famin there growing, and the mortality ſtill increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, with <hi>Conons</hi> conſent he adventured in a ſmall bark alone to go ſecretly to <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius,</hi> and hardly eſcaping, he met with <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and incouraging him, drew him to undertake the buſineſſe. <hi>Totilas</hi> hearing of the Fleet coming back, prepared many <hi>Pinnaces</hi> ſwift of ſail, and the enemy being upon the coaſt neer <hi>Naples,</hi> he ſet on them ſuddenly, amazed them, and put them to flight; killing many and taking more: They only eſcaped, who at firſt leapt into the cock-boats, among whom was <hi>Demetrius</hi> the Generall. The ſhipps the Goths took with all their men and Lading, and there ſound <hi>Demetrius</hi> the Procurator of <hi>Naples,</hi> whoſe Tongue they cut out, and ſo let him go whether he would; ſuch was the puniſhment of <hi>Demetrius</hi> for his intemperate language. Afterward came <hi>Maximinus</hi> with his Fleet upon the coaſt of <hi>Sicily,</hi> where he ſate ſtill in <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> afraid of the war. The Roman commanders, and eſpecially <hi>Conon</hi> from <hi>Naples</hi> (whom all proviſions now failed) ſent to him to come to their ſuccours: He wore out the ſeaſon in this cowardly fear; but at laſt fearing the Emperours menaces, and wearied with the revilings of all men, he ſtaied himſelf; but ſent the army to <hi>Naples</hi> under <hi>Demetrius, Herodian,</hi> and <hi>Phazas</hi> in the ſharpeſt of the winter.

                  <q>Citizens of <hi>Naples,</hi> we do not now beſiege you upon any quarrell we have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you; but to diſingage you from Maſters that hate you, and to have the power to recompenſe the ſervice of every one of you to us, and his ſufferings<pb n="82" facs="tcp:50471:117"/>from the Enemy, you of all the Italians having ſhewed greateſt affection to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and with moſt unwillingneſſe come under the enemy; that now being neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſarily to beſiege you, we bluſh when we thinke of your fidelity, though wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege you not for your hurt. Think not therefore, as offended with the accidents of the ſiege, that you muſt he ever angry with us. They who ſtudy the Good of their freinds, are not to be blamed by them, when they are inforced to do them good by none of the gentleſt meanes. And be not affraid of the Enemy, nor thinke by what hath paſt, that they will conquer at laſt: ſtrange, unlookt for, and accidentall things melt away in time. We have thus determined of you, to ſuffer <hi>Conon</hi> and his Souldiers to go free without harm, or loſſe, they preſently ſurrendring the City unto us; and upon this we are ready to ſwear that the <hi>Napolitans</hi> ſhall be ſafe.</q> Both <hi>Conon</hi> and the Napolitans accepted this offer of <hi>Totilas,</hi> being extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſt with the Famine; but to comply with their faith to the Emperour, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſome hope of ſuccours, they promiſed to ſurrender the City within thirty daies. <hi>Totilas</hi> to put ſuch hopes out of their heads, aſſigned three Moneths, in which time he would not aſſault nor have any deſigne upon them.

Then having reſtored them to ſtrength, he ſet open the Gates, and let them go that would. <hi>Conon,</hi> and ſuch Souldiers as would not ſtay with him, he ſhipped, and bade them ſail whether they pleaſed: They were aſhamed to return to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> but making towards <hi>Rome,</hi> the wind came croſſe, and being not able to get away, they feared leaſt <hi>Totilas</hi> might neglect his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greements, and do them miſcheif: but he perceiving their trouble, called them to him, comforted and cheered them, and invited them to joyne with the Goths, and buy what they wanted, or take it as from freinds. The wind continuing contrary a long time, he furniſhed them with horſes, waggons, and proviſions, and gave them a convoy of Goths to <hi>Rome:</hi> But the walls of <hi>Naples</hi> he threw to the Gound; that the Romans might not (ſurprizing the Town) infeſt the Goths from it: his deſire being rather to determin the war at once by a battell, then to be ever skirmiſhing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt artifices, and ſtratagems: yet he left a good part of the ſaid walls ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>There came to him at that time a Roman of <hi>Calabria,</hi> complaining, that one of his Life Guard had forced his daughter, a Virgin; he in great anger put the man in priſon, not denying the fact, and was eager to puniſh him; but the cheif Goths fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the mans behalf, being valiant, and a good ſouldier, aſſembled themſelves in his preſence, and beſought him to pardon the crime; he mildly, and without any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation, made them this anſwer. <q>Fellow ſouldiers, I ſhall ſpeak to you, not from any humour of cruelty, or delight in my countrymens miſ-fortunes; but from my fear of ſome ill conſequence unto us. I know that moſt men ſhift the names of things to their contrary; they call the inobſervation of Lawes, Mercy; and hence all good things come to be corrupted, and confounded.</q> On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to pinch upon Lawes too exactly, is perverſe and greivous, and alſo to uſe ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <q>names, as a veile to a lincentious power, thereby to act wickedneſſe with more ſecurity. But you I adviſe by no means to exchange your own ſafety for the guilt of another mans ſin, nor to ſhare in his impiety, having done no ill your ſelves: For to commit an offence, and to hinder the offenders puniſhment is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall. Conſider thus the buſineſſe now preſented, and determine accordingly; you have the choice offered you, whether this man ſhall eſcape the juſt puniſhment of his offence, or our nation be preſerved, and conquer in this war. Think what num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Souldiers we had in the beginning of it, how famous, how well experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in war; in a word, our endleſſe wealth, abundance of horſe and armes, and all the ſtrong holds of <hi>Italy,</hi> and theſe were important preparations for a Warr.</q> But when under <hi>Theodatus,</hi> a man that valued riches more then right, we made God
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:50471:117"/>
                  <q>angry with us by our lawleſſe living; how we ſped you all know, and by what kind of men, and by how many we were beaten. Now God, having ſufficiently puniſhed our faults, frames our life to his own will, and conducts our affaires be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our hopes. And being ſuch now, and having vanquiſht our Enemies, not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably to our powers, it will be more advantagious for us, to prepare a fair occaſion of victory by doing that which is juſt, then by the contrary to appear envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of our own Good For it cannot, it cannot be, that he that practiſes wrong and oppreſſion; ſhould get honour in the day of battell: the fortune of the War is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to mans good or bad lives.</q> The cheif Goths upon this ſpeech of <hi>Totilas,</hi> ceaſed to intercede for the offender, and left him to him; who ſoon after put him to death, and beſtowed his Eſtate upon the raviſhed maid.</p>
               <p>In this mean time the Roman army preyed upon the Subjects, leaving no inſolence unacted. Their commanders in their Garriſons with their Miſtreſſes lived riotouſly; having the Souldiers diſobedient, and full of all kind of diſorders: between both the armies, the Italians ſuffered the hardeſt meaſures; the Enemy took their lands from them, and the Emperours army their goods: they were baſely beaten for nothing, and periſhed for want of food. The Souldiers could not defend them from the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and were ſo far from bluſhing to ſee their miſeries, that by their wrongs they made the Barbarians dear unto them. <hi>Conſtianus</hi> troubled at this, wrote to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinian,</hi> profeſſing his diſability to incounter the Goths: and the Commanders ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Letter, being a confeſſion of their baſe fear to fight.</p>

                  <q>
                     <hi>Totilas</hi> alſo ſent this Letter to the Roman Senat. When men ignorantly, or upon forgetfullneſſe do wrong, the wronged are to be eaſie to grant pardon: The cauſe of the offence concurring in ſuch, excuſeth the heavieſt of the accuſation. But a man that does wrong upon malice, is not to be admitted ſo much as to plead; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he is to bear the blame not only of his fact; but of his intent. Which being ſo, what can you apologize for your actions againſt the Goths? Can you be ignorant of the favours of <hi>Theoderick</hi> and <hi>Amalaſuntha?</hi> or can time wear them out of your remembrance? neither is poſſible. The benefits have not been mean, nor are of an ancient date; but in the moſt important things, and lately done. For the Greeks Goodneſſe to their ſubjects, your ſelves have, heard of it, and you have had triall of it, and you have known how the Goths and Italians have ſped under them. What Gueſts and freinds they have been to you, the Audits of <hi>Alexander</hi> may inform you, to ſay nothing of their Souldiers and Captaines; you have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed their noble uſage, by which their affaires are come into this caſe now. Think not this to be the reproaches of an inſolent young man, nor the vaunts of a Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Prince. I ſay not, that our ſubduing of theſe men is a work of my valour; but that due vengeance for the injuries done to you hath overtaken them. And how ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly it ſhewes, that God ſhould puniſh them for you, and yet you adhere to their folly, and refuſe deliverance from the miſeries ariſing from thence. Make therefore ſome introduction of an apologie, and of our pardoning you; which will be, if while you have ſome hope (though a poor one) you chuſe what is beſt for you, and repaire what you have done amiſſe againſt us.</q>

               <p>THE newes of theſe things troubled the Emperour; and though the <hi>Perſian</hi> War lay heavily upon him, he was conſtrained to ſend <hi>Beliſarius</hi> againſt <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilas;</hi> and the Winter ended, and the ninth yeare of this War, written by <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copius;</hi> when <hi>Beliſarius</hi> went the ſecond time into <hi>Italy.</hi>

                  </note> Having but few Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, (as being not able to withdraw his own Forces from the Army in <hi>Perſia</hi>) he levied with his own money Voluntaries in <hi>Thrace,</hi> being aſſiſted by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours direction with <hi>Vitalius,</hi> Generall of <hi>Illyrium,</hi> lately returned from <hi>Italy,</hi> where he had left the <hi>Illyrian</hi> Cohorts; they both raiſed 4000. men, and came to <hi>Salona,</hi> determining to go to <hi>Ravenna,</hi> and thence to make the War: For about <hi>Rome</hi> they found they could not land uneſpyed, (the Enemy being in <hi>Campania</hi> and <hi>Calabria</hi>) nor yet force their landing, being inferiour in powers.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the Garriſon in <hi>Otranto</hi> (the Victuall being abſolutely fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,) capitulated about the ſurrender of the Caſtle, by a day aſſigned. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> put a yeares Victuall aboard Ships, and commanded <hi>Valentinus</hi> to tranſport it to <hi>Otranto,</hi> and to take out the former Garriſon, pined with Sickneſſe, and Famine, and put in the Souldiers he had with him aboard, being freſh and well ſupplyed. <hi>Valentinus</hi> with a faire wind got to <hi>Otranto</hi> four daies before the time aſſigned, and finding the Harbour unguarded, was Maſter of it, and entred the Caſtle without reſiſtance. The <hi>Goths</hi> being careleſſe, and lying ſtill under their confidence in the Capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and imagining no oppoſition, and then ſeeing the Fleet enter, ran away in feare, and encamped themſelves ſome diſtance from the Town, and advertiſed <hi>Totilas</hi> of what happened. Some Troops of <hi>Valentinus</hi> from <hi>Otranto</hi> made in-roads into the Country, and meeting the Enemy upon the Sea ſhoare, they fought, were beaten, and moſt of them fled into the Sea; where having loſt 170. men, the reſt retired into the Caſtle. But <hi>Valentinus,</hi> as <hi>Beliſarius</hi> commanded, took out the old Garriſon, (being men halfe dead) and leaving freſh men with a yeares Victuall, he went to <hi>Salonae</hi> with the reſt. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> from thence came with the Fleet before <hi>Pola;</hi> where he ſtaid, and ordered the Army. <hi>Totilas</hi> hearing of his coming, and being deſirous to know his Forces, he wrote Letters to him in the name of one <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> Nephew to one <hi>John,</hi> and Commander of the Garriſon in <hi>Genoa,</hi> entreating his ſpeedy repaire to him, as being in much diſtreſſe and danger. This Letter he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to five witty fellowes, directing them to ſpy what Forces <hi>Beliſarius</hi> had, and to give out that they came from <hi>Bonus. Beliſarius</hi> uſed the men courteouſly, (as his manner was) peruſed the Letter, and bad them tell <hi>Bonus</hi> that he would be with him with his Army. They having ſpyed into every thing, returned to the Camp to <hi>Totilas,</hi> aſſuring him that <hi>Beliſarius</hi> powers were not conſiderable.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Totilas</hi> took <hi>Tibur,</hi> which had in it a Garriſon of <hi>Iſaurians:</hi> Some of the Towneſ-men, guarding the Gates with the <hi>Iſaurians,</hi> fell into an idle brable with them, and upon that ground drew in the Enemy by night. The <hi>Iſau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> rallyed themſelves (ſeeing the Town taken) and almoſt all got away; but of the Towneſ-men the <hi>Goths</hi> ſpared not a man, and killed the Biſhop of the Town in a faſhion, which I will conceale, not to leave to Poſterity Monuments of Inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity: And one <hi>Catellus,</hi> a man much eſteemed in <hi>Italy,</hi> periſht alſo. Thus the <hi>Goths</hi> having <hi>Tibur,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens could no more import Proviſions out of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> by the River of <hi>Tiber,</hi> the Town being upon the River 15. miles above <hi>Rome,</hi> and commanding the paſſage thither. Then came <hi>Beliſarius</hi> to <hi>Ravennae</hi> with his Fleet, and calling to him the <hi>Goths</hi> there, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers, he ſpake thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>It is not now only, that Vice hath ruined, what hath been built by Virtue; from the beginning it hath been ſo in humane Affaires. The lewdneſſe of bad men hath been ſtill able to demoliſh the Actions of the good. This hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the Emperours Affaires; who to repaire the Errour, hath made leſſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſubduing the <hi>Perſians,</hi> then of it; and hath ſent me to cure the Faults committed by either Captaines, Souldiers, or <hi>Goths.</hi> It is above humane condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not to erre, but it becomes the Emperour to repaire the Errours of thoſe,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:50471:118"/>whom from his Soule he loves; whereby you ſhall be alſo eaſed of your grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, and both perceive and feele his good affection towards you, then which what Wealth is more valuable. My coming therefore being to this purpoſe, it behoves you to endeavour the obtaining of that Fruit, which will ariſe from thence. If any of you have Friends, or Kinſmen with <hi>Totilas</hi> the Uſurper, let him ſend for them, acquainting them with the Emperours intention. Thus you may find good both from a peace, and the Emperours Favour for me: I come not to pick Quarrels, nor to be an Enemy to the Emperours Subjects by my good will: But if ſome will ſtill make ſlight the chuſing their own good, and others take Armes againſt us;</q> we muſt, though moſt unwillingly, uſe ſuch as Enemies. <hi>Beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarius</hi> ſpake thus; but no <hi>Goth,</hi> nor <hi>Roman</hi> came into him; ſo he ſent <hi>Therimuth,</hi> one of his Life-guard, with ſome of his own Retinew, and <hi>Vitalius</hi> with the <hi>Illy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Cohorts into <hi>Emilia,</hi> to attempt the Townes there: <hi>Vitalius</hi> came to <hi>Bono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and after the taking of ſome Caſtles by compoſition, lay ſtill there. Soon after the <hi>Illyrians</hi> retired home upon the ſuddain, having ſuffered nothing, nor ſo much as heard any ill. They ſent Agents to the Emperour, for pardon of this Retreat, in regard they had long ſerved in <hi>Italy,</hi> and received no pay, and much was due to them from the Treaſury. They heard beſides of an Army of <hi>Hunnes,</hi> which in <hi>Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyrium</hi> made Captives their Wives and Children, which cauſed them (wanting neceſſaries alſo) to go home all in one Troop. The Emperour was troubled at the proceeding, but at laſt pardoned them. <hi>Totilas</hi> hearing of the <hi>Illyrians</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, ſent Forces to drive <hi>Vitalius</hi> and his Troops out of <hi>Bononia,</hi> who with <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimuth</hi> laid an Ambuſh for them, killed many, and routed the reſt; where <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res</hi> an <hi>Illyrian</hi> Captain of good quality, did Miracles upon the Enemy. <hi>Therimuth</hi> then returned to <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> who ſent him <hi>Nicetas,</hi> and <hi>Sabinianus</hi> with 1000. men to <hi>Auximum,</hi> to re-enforce <hi>Magnus</hi> there beſeiged. They by night got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Town unſeen by <hi>Totilas</hi> and the Enemies Camp. The next day at noon, they ſallied to encounter a party of Enemies they had notice of; ſending before avant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coureurs to diſcover their Forces, that they might not blindly ſet on them. <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilas</hi> of the Life-Guard to <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> being in drink, would himſelfe go upon the diſcovery, and gallopt on alone. In a rough ſtony way he met three <hi>Goths,</hi> and made a ſtand, as to fight with them, being very Valiant; but when he ſaw more coming in from all ſides, he ran away. His Horſe in the rough ground came over and over with him, at which the Enemy gave a great ſhout, and darted all their Javelins at him; the <hi>Romans</hi> perceiving it, went to his reſcue, but he was covered with Javelins, and dyed upon the place. <hi>Therimuth</hi> took up his dead body and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed it into <hi>Auximum,</hi> having met with a concluſion of life not ſutable to the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the man.</p>

                  <hi>SAbinianus</hi> and <hi>Therimuth</hi> upon conference with <hi>Magnus,</hi> and conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the inconvenience of their longer ſtay, being ſo far under-matcht to the Enemy, and by conſuming the Townes Proviſion making it more ready to be loſt, they prepared to be gone, and to begin their journey in the night: But a Souldier ran out to the Enemies Camp cloſely, and revealed the deſigne. <hi>Totilas</hi> choſe out 1000. good men, and laid them concealed three miles and three quarters from <hi>Auximum.</hi> Theſe perceiving the Enemy at midnight upon the way, fell to work with their Swords, and killed 200. but being dark, <hi>Sabinianus</hi> and <hi>Therimuth</hi> got away to <hi>Ariminum;</hi> all the Baggage, Armes and Apparell, the <hi>Goths</hi> took. Between <hi>Auximum</hi> and <hi>Ariminum</hi> are two ſmall Townes, <hi>Piſaurus</hi> and <hi>Phanus</hi> upon the <hi>Jonian</hi> Gulfe. <hi>Vitigis</hi> in the beginning of the War had burnt the houſes, and broken down halfe their Walls, that the <hi>Romans</hi> ſurpriſing them, might not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the <hi>Goths. Piſaurus Beliſarius</hi> reſolved to ſeiſe, as a place fit for Horſe-pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures; he ſent ſome in the night to take the exact meaſure of the Dimenſion of each Gate, then framed Gates lined with Iron, and ſent them thither by Sea, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding <hi>Sabinianus</hi> and <hi>Therimuth</hi> to ſet them up, and to ſtay in the Town; and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:50471:119"/>being ſecure, to repaire the Walls with ſtones, and earth, as they could. This they did; and <hi>Totilas</hi> upon the news came againſt them with a great Army. But failing to take the Towne, after much time ſpent in the attempt, hee retired to his Camp before <hi>Auximum:</hi> Where the <hi>Romans</hi> ſallied no more, but kept cloſe within their walls. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> ſent <hi>Artaſiras</hi> a <hi>Perſian,</hi> and <hi>Barbation</hi> a <hi>Thracian,</hi> two of his Life-guard, to guard <hi>Rome</hi> with <hi>Beſſas,</hi> being there already, directing them not to ſally at all.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Totilas</hi> finding <hi>Beliſarius</hi> not able to fight with him, fell upon the ſtrong Townes; in <hi>Picenia</hi> he block'd up <hi>Firmum,</hi> and <hi>Aſculum:</hi> and ſo ended the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the tenth yeare of this War, written by <hi>Procopius.</hi>

                  </note> making him ſweare to return ſpeedily, and to importune the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour for an Army and money, horſes, and armes; the Souldiers being few, and refuſing to fight, becauſe of their wants, the Treaſury owing them much money. And he wrote of theſe particulars to the Emperour in theſe words.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Moſt mighty Emperour! We are come into <hi>Italy,</hi> wanting men, horſes, arms, and money; And without a competent preparation of theſe, no man can make Warre. Our <hi>Thracians</hi> and <hi>Illyrians</hi> we behold here few, wretched, and ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling without Arms, and unexerciſed for any fight; The reſt deficient, fearfull of the Enemy, with ſpirits dejected by their often beating, and not ſimple running away only, but quitting their Horſes, and throwing down their Armes. To raiſe contribution in <hi>Italy</hi> is not poſſible, it being poſſeſt by the Enemy; And being behind with the Souldiers for their Pay, we cannot lay commands on them, the debt taking away our confidence. And the moſt of thoſe that ſerved your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie are run to the Enemy. If nothing therefore needed, but the ſending <hi>Beliſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> the Warr is excellently prepared; for I am in the midſt of <hi>Italy.</hi> But if you meane to vanquiſh your Enemies, there muſt be other preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. No Generall can ſubſiſt without men to follow him. Above all things it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves therefore, that you ſend me mine owne Lanciers and Targettiers, and ſtore of <hi>Hunnes</hi> and other <hi>Barbarians,</hi> who muſt have preſent money.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus wrote <hi>Beliſarius:</hi> But <hi>John</hi> ſtaying long at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> effected nothing for what he came thither, but marryed the Daughter of <hi>Germanus,</hi> brothers ſonne to the Emperour.</p>
               <p>In the meane time <hi>Totilas</hi> tooke <hi>Firmum</hi> and <hi>Aſculum</hi> by compoſition; and in <hi>Tuſcany</hi> beſieged <hi>Spoletum,</hi> and <hi>Aſſiſium. Herodian</hi> commanded the Garriſon in <hi>Spoletum;</hi> and that of <hi>Asſiſium, Siſiphris</hi> a <hi>Goth,</hi> but well affected to the <hi>Romans. Herodian</hi> agreed to render the Towne with himſelfe and Souldiers within thirty days, if no ſuccour came, and gave his ſonne for Hoſtage. And the day preſixed being come, and no <hi>Romans</hi> appearing, <hi>Herodian</hi> and the Souldiers yielded themſelves and the Town to <hi>Totilas.</hi> Some ſay that <hi>Herodian</hi> did this upon hatred to <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> who threatned to queſtion him for his rapines and oppreſſion. <hi>Siſiphris</hi> in <hi>Aſſiſium</hi> made ſome ſallies, and in the end moſt of his men and himſelfe were ſlaine; whereat the Townſ-men deſpairing, rendred the Towne. <hi>Totilas</hi> alſo ſent to <hi>Peruſia,</hi> threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Cyprianus</hi> there, if he would not yeeld the Town to him, and promiſing him money to do it. Not prevailing with him, he practiſed with <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>liphus,</hi> one of his Life-guard, for money to murder him; who watch'd him when he was alone, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving killed him, ran to <hi>Totilas.</hi> Yet the Garriſon kept the Towne for the Emperor, and the <hi>Goths</hi> retired from it. Then went <hi>Totilas</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and beſieged it. To the Husbandmen of <hi>Italy</hi> he did no damage, letting them ſecurely manure their Land, paying to him the rents and tributes reſerved to the Treaſury, or the Owners At <hi>Rome,</hi> ſome <hi>Goths</hi> approaching the walls, <hi>Artaſiras</hi> and <hi>Barbation</hi> (againſt the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Beſſas</hi>) ſallyed with ſome Troops, and killed many, routing the reſt; whom purſuing too far, they fell into the Enemies Ambuſhes, where they loſt moſt of their men, and eſcaped narrowly themſelves, and afterward for bare to charge the Enemy, though they preſt upon them.</p>
               <p>Hence the Famine grew ſore in <hi>Rome,</hi> no Victuall coming in by Land, and being ſhut from the Sea. For the <hi>Goths,</hi> after they had <hi>Naples,</hi> kept a kind of a Fleet of ſmall Barques about the Iſlands of <hi>Aeolus,</hi> and other Iſlands in that Sea, which guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded exactly the paſſage of ſhips; that all from <hi>Sicily,</hi> ſailing to the Port of <hi>Rome,</hi> fell among them.</p>

And at the ſame time the Commanders in <hi>Rome</hi> were jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of <hi>Cethegus,</hi> a <hi>Patrician,</hi> that he betrayed them; who thereupon fled to <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumcellae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beliſarius</hi> fearing the loſſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of all the reſt; and from <hi>Ravenna,</hi> and with ſo ſmall an Army, to releive them being not able, he reſolved to riſe from thence, and to ſurprize ſome places neer <hi>Rome,</hi> from whence he might aide it in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe. He repented his coming to <hi>Ravenna,</hi> upon the perſwaſions of <hi>Vitalius,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantageouſly for the Emperours ſervice; For being ſhut up there, he gave the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy free ſcope to advance their affairs. Either <hi>Beliſarius</hi> choſe the worſt, that the <hi>Romans</hi> might have a miſchiefe; or he choſe the beſt: but God croſt it, purpoſing to favour <hi>Totilas</hi> and the <hi>Goths,</hi> and turning <hi>Beliſarias</hi> good counſells to the quite contrary. So when Fortune blows a faire gale, mens worſt counſells meete no diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, being waſted by the higher power to all advantages. Unfortunate men either adviſe nothing well, their fate hiding from them all knowledge and right apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of things: Or adviſing well, fortune with a croſſe wind turns their good advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to bad events.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Beliſarius</hi> left <hi>Ravenna,</hi> committing the guard of it to <hi>Juſtinus;</hi> and through <hi>Dalmatia</hi> came to <hi>Epidamnus,</hi> where he ſtaid, expecting an Army from <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> and by his letters acquainting the Emperour with his condition. Who ſent him an Army of <hi>Barbarians</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers under <hi>John,</hi> the Nephew of <hi>Vitali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> the <hi>Armenian,</hi> Brother to <hi>Aratius,</hi> and <hi>Narſes;</hi> who coming to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidamnus,</hi> joyned with <hi>Beliſarius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He ſent alſo <hi>Narſes</hi> the Eunuch to the <hi>Herulian</hi> Princes, to obtaine aides of them for <hi>Italy.</hi> Many <hi>Herulians</hi> came along with him, under <hi>Philimuth</hi> and others, to the confines of <hi>Thrace,</hi> there to Winter, and at the beginning of the Spring to be ſent to <hi>Beliſarius.</hi> With them was <hi>John Phagas</hi> In this journey they did the <hi>Romans</hi> a great ſervice by chance. A multitude of <hi>Slavonians</hi> had paſſed the River <hi>Iſter,</hi> and ſack'd the Towns thereabout, and taken abundance of <hi>Roman</hi> Captives. The <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulians</hi> fought with them, and though inferiour in numbers, beate them, and killed many, and freed the captives, and ſent them home.</p>

               <p>AT that time <hi>Narſes</hi> diſcovered the impoſture of one naming himſelfe <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>budius,</hi> who had been a famous Generall of the <hi>Romans.</hi> This <hi>Chilbudius</hi> was firſt of <hi>Iuſtinian's</hi> Retinew, a valiant Souldier, and ſo great a deſpiſer of wealth, that it was his greateſt riches to poſſeſſe nothing. <hi>Juſtinian</hi> in the fourth yeare of his Reign made him Generall of <hi>Thrace,</hi> and gave him the guard of the River <hi>Iſter,</hi> to hinder the paſſage of <hi>Barbarians;</hi> the <hi>Hunnes</hi> formerly, <hi>Antians</hi> and <hi>Slavonians</hi> having come over, and done much miſchiefe to the <hi>Romans. Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>budius</hi> grew ſo terrible there, that in his three years continuance in that charge, not a <hi>Barbarian</hi> durſt paſſe the River; and the <hi>Romans</hi> under <hi>Chilbudius</hi> invaded the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, and killed and took many Captives. After three yeares he paſſed over the River with a ſmall Army; the <hi>Slavonians</hi> in a Battaile ſtifly fought, killed many <hi>Romans,</hi> and <hi>Chilbudins</hi> the Generall. From thence forward the <hi>Barbarians</hi> came over at pleaſure, and the Provinces lay open to them; all the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire in this not countervailing the valour of one man. After this the <hi>Antians</hi> and <hi>Slavonians</hi> fell out, and in a Battaile the <hi>Antians</hi> were vanquiſht. Wherein a <hi>Slavonian</hi> took a youth of the Enemy named <hi>Chilbudius,</hi> and led him home. This man in time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came very affectionate to his Maſter, and valiant againſt the Enemy; having often fought ſingularly well, hazarding for his Maſter, and ſo getting a great reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. About the ſame time the <hi>Antians</hi> entred <hi>Thrace,</hi> which they pillaged, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:50471:120"/>took many Captives; one of whom Fortune brought to a gentle Maſter. But the fellow being a knave, and cunning to deceive, and deſirous withall to return to his owne Countrey, came once to his Maſter, and commended his humanity, which God (he ſaid) would reward, and himſelfe would not be ungratefull to ſo kind a Maſter; but if he would follow his advice, he would make him a rich man. For a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Slavonians</hi> was one <hi>Chilbudius</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Generall, unknown, and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a ſlave; whom if he would ranſome, and conduct into <hi>Roman</hi> Land, he ſhould get the Emperours favour, and a great reward. Thus this <hi>Roman</hi> perſwaded his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and with him went into <hi>Slavonia,</hi> there being truce then between them, and ſafe intercourſe. Hee paid the ranſome to this <hi>Chilbudius</hi> Maſter, and took him home; where he ask'd the man if he were <hi>Chilbudius</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Generall. He told him all the truth; that he was an <hi>Antian,</hi> and taken Priſoner by the <hi>Slavonians</hi> then Enemies, but now being reſtored to his Countrey, he claimed freedome according to the Law.</p>
               <p>The man who had laid out his money, ſtood mute, and vexed to fall from his hopes thus. But the <hi>Roman</hi> cheered him up, and to out-face the truth, that it might not croſſe his return home, confidently ſaid that it was <hi>Chilbudius;</hi> but being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <hi>Barbarians,</hi> he was afraid to reveale himſelfe; Were he once upon <hi>Roman</hi> ground, he would be proud of the name, as he had reaſon. In the end the buſineſs came to the knowledg of all the <hi>Antians;</hi> who ſtird in it, pretending a publique intereſt, and imagining to make a great advantage, of having <hi>Chilbudius</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Generall.</p>
               <p>Theſe people both <hi>Antians</hi> and <hi>Slavonians,</hi> are not under a Prince, but ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are a Democratie: whence all things are brought to the common vote. They have almoſt the ſame Laws and cuſtomes: They hold one God, who makes the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and is only Lord of all things. To him they ſacrifice Oxen and other victimes. They acknowledg no deſtiny to govern among men; when Death threatens either in a ſickneſſe, or in a Warr; they promiſe if they may eſcape, to offer to God a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice in recompence for their life: And if they eſcape, they pay their vow, and think they have bought their ſafety. They worſhip alſo Rivers, Nymphs, and other Spirits, to whom they ſacrifice too; and by thoſe ſacrifices make their predictions. They dwell in poor wretched Booths, ſcattered, and ſtill ſhifting their habitations. In fights the moſt part ſerve on foot, with Shields and Javelins, having no Corſelets, and ſome not ſo much as a Coate, or Mantle; but they tye up their Trouſes above their Privities, and ſo enter into the fight. They both uſe one Language, and that a very barbarous one: And they differ not in ſhape, being all tall and very ſtrong. Their haire is neither very white, nor yellow, nor yet black at all, but inclining to red. They live hardly, and ſlovenly like the <hi>Hunnes;</hi> wicked they are not, nor cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but in their ſimplicity much of the <hi>Hunniſh</hi> diſpoſition. They had both for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly but one name, and were called <hi>Spori,</hi> becauſe they pitch their booths <hi>

                  </hi> ſcatteredly; and ſo they take up much ſpace of Land, holding the moſt part of the other ſide of the River Iſter.</p>
               <p>But then the <hi>Antians</hi> in their Aſſembly urged the ſaid man to acknowledge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be <hi>Chilbudius,</hi> and denying it, threatned him. In the meane time came Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors to them from <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> who offered to plant them in <hi>Turris,</hi> an ancient City built by <hi>Trajan;</hi> which had been ſack'd by <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and layen long waſt. <hi>Juſtinian</hi> offered them this City, and the Countrey about, formerly belonging to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and to plant them in it with his powers; and beſides to give them great ſummes of money; Conditionally they ſhould keep a perpetuall league with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and hinder the <hi>Hunnes</hi> from over-running the Empire that way. They liked the Propoſition, and promiſed to do ſo, if the Emperour would make <hi>Chilbudius</hi> his Generall, to ſettle their Plantation, affirming that man to be <hi>Chilbudius:</hi> And the fellow exalted with theſe hopes, had now a mind to it, and took the name upon him. So he was ſent to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and upon his way thither, <hi>Narſes</hi> met him; and upon ſpeech with him, found him a counterſet; yet he ſpake Latine, and had many marks of <hi>Chilbudius,</hi> which he cunningly aſſumed. <hi>Narſes</hi> kept him cloſe Priſoner, and at laſt got out of him all the matter, and tooke him with him to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople.</hi>

               <p>IN the mean time <hi>Beliſarius</hi> ſent <hi>Valentinus,</hi> and one of his life Guard named <hi>Phocas,</hi> an expert Souldier, with forces to the Haven of <hi>Rome,</hi> directing them to guard the caſtle of <hi>Portus,</hi> with the Garriſon already there, commanded by <hi>Innocentius,</hi> and by excurſions from thence to infeſt the Enemies camp. They accordingly ſent word to <hi>Beſſas</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> that they were ready to give a ſudden a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larme to the Enemies quarters, praying him when he ſaw the fight begun, to ride out to ſecond them with ſome of his choice men; that ſo both together might do ſome ſervice upon the Enemy. <hi>Beſſas,</hi> though he had 3000 Souldiers, liked it not: yet <hi>Valentinus</hi> and <hi>Phocas</hi> with 500 charged of a ſudden, and killed ſome. The beſieged ſaw the ſtir and tumult, but ſallied not; ſo that the other retired ſafe to <hi>Portus.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain they ſent to <hi>Beſſas,</hi> complaining of his unbeſeeming ſloth, and that they would make another Excurſion, praying him to charge at the ſame time with all his army; but he refuſed to hazard a ſally. So <hi>Valentinus</hi> and <hi>Phocas</hi> reſolved to charge with greater forces. But a Souldier of <hi>Innocentius</hi> ran away to <hi>Totilas,</hi> advertizing him how from <hi>Portus</hi> he would be aſſaulted the next day. <hi>Totilas</hi> laid ambuſhes in their way, into which the next day they fell, and with the loſſe of moſt of their men were ſlain themſelves; few eſcaped to <hi>Portus.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Vigilius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> being then in <hi>Sicily,</hi> ſent ſome ſhips laden with corn, by ſome means to be put into <hi>Rome.</hi> The Enemy ſaw them coming into the harbour, and hid themſelves in houſes, to ſurprize them ſo ſoon as they put to land; which the Garriſon in <hi>Portus</hi> perceiving, from the battlements, they waved their Garments to thoſe in the ſhips, to come no neerer, but to turn ſome other way. But they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding not their ſignes, took them for rejoycings at their coming, and invitings into the harbour; and the wind being fair they ſoon got in. There were Roman paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers aboard, and <hi>Valentinus</hi> a Biſhop; and the Goths from their Ambuſh ſeized upon the ſhips, none reſiſting, and put all to the ſword ſave the Biſhop, whom they brought priſoner to <hi>Totilas:</hi> and he, after he had queſtioned what he would, cut off his hands, charging him that he had not ſpoke truth. And then ended the Winter, &amp; the eleventh year of this war, written by <hi>Procopius.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Vigilius</hi> alſo, Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> left <hi>Sicily,</hi>

               <p>In <hi>Placentia,</hi> the beſieged Romans wanting victuall fell to food abominated, and in the End to eat one another; ſo that they rendred upon Compoſition. <hi>Rome</hi> alſo was deſtitute of all proviſions; where was <hi>Pelagius,</hi> a Deacon of the ſame, who had long dwelt in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> much favored by <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> and was grown rich; and lately come to <hi>Rome,</hi> he ſpent moſt of his riches upon men in want in this ſiege, and for his bounty got a great fame; being famous before through all <hi>Italy.</hi> The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans having ſuffered under the famin incredibly, ſent this <hi>Pelagius</hi> to <hi>Tetilas</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſome few dayes of ceſſation, conditionally, that if during the ſame, no ſuccours came from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to render themſelves upon a Compoſition. <hi>Pelagius</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly came to <hi>Totilas,</hi> who ſaluted him with much reverence and curteſie, and firſt ſpake to him thus. <q>Almoſt all Barbarians reverence Ambaſſadors, but I beſides, have from my youth honored vertuous men like your ſelf. And I know that the honouring or diſgracing an Ambaſſador, is diſcerned not by fair countenances and hollow-hearted complements, but by true and reall dealing; he is moſt hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red who hath the plain truth told him, and is ſo diſmiſt: and he moſt affronted, who carries home nothing, but fained, deceitfull words. So that <hi>Pelagius,</hi> there are three things, which if you ask not, you ſhall obtain all the reſt; and it is good you ſhould not mention them, leaſt being the cauſe of your own effecting nothing, you lay the blame on us; the not asking things ſutable to the condition of affaires producing commonly want of ſucceſſe This then I ſay, move not for any <hi>Sicilian,</hi> nor for ſparing the walls of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor for reſtitution of your fugitive ſervants. For it cannot be, that the <hi>Goths</hi> ſhould favour a <hi>Sicilian,</hi> that theſe walls ſhould ſtand, or that our Souldiers ſhould return again to be ſlaves to their Maſters. And I will tell you my reaſons of theſe propoſitions, that they may not ſeem to proceed
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50471:121"/>from a willfullneſſe. <hi>Sicily</hi> hath been ever happy, rich, and moſt fruitfull, not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying only the Inhabitants; but tranſporting alſo to you of <hi>Rome,</hi> yearly ſufficient for your uſes; whereupon you beſought <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rick</hi> not to place Garriſons in it; leaſt it might decay in the Liberties and happineſſe thereof. Things being thus, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the coming of a Fleet of Enemies upon the Coaſt, not comparable to our powers, the <hi>Sicilians</hi> neither advertized the Goths, nor ſhut their Gates, nor op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed them in any ſort, but with all alacrity received them with open armes, like perſidious ſlaves, who long had watcht an opportunity to run from their old ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to ſtrangers. Hence the Enemy iſſued and got all <hi>Italy,</hi> ſurprizing <hi>Rome,</hi> and maintaining it againſt more then a yeares ſiege, with the abundance of corne brought out of <hi>Sicily.</hi> Thus it ſtands with the Sicilians, whom the <hi>Goths</hi> cannot pardon, the hainouſneſſe of their crimes making them incapable of mercy. Theſe walls when the Enemy had once got into, they could never be drawn to a battell in open feild: with ſtratagems and circumventions they cluded our powers, and became ſtrangely Lords of all we had: And now we muſt prevent the like here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. Men ignorantly undone, to fall again into the ſame ruin whereof they had experience before, is not to be attributed to the croſneſſe of Fortune, but to their own groſſe Folly. Beſides, the demoliſhing your walls is your own advantage; Neither part hereafter being to be ſhut within them, and ſtarved by the beſieging adverſary. So that both will put it to the fortune of a battell, and you without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring danger, will be the prize of the victor. Touching your fugitive ſlaves, who have fought for us, and have our promiſe not to abandon them to their former Maſters, if we ſhould now betray them, even your ſelves will never truſt us; it being impoſſible that he that neglects his Engagements to men of all the moſt to be pityed, ſhould be conſtant to any: It will be a Character of his falſehood to all that meet him. To this Speech of <hi>Totilas, Pelagius</hi> thus anſwered. Great Sir, having intimated your reſpect of my Perſon, and of the quality of an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour, yet have you ranckt both in the baſeſt condition. I conceive him to affront more his Friend, and an Ambaſſadour, who reſolves to ſend him away without his buſineſſe, then he that ſtrikes, or otherwiſe abuſes him. Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours come not to receive honours from thoſe who admit them, but to get diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches for their good that ſent them. It is better they were affronted at firſt, and at laſt effect that they come for; then after many Careſſes, to return with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their hopes. So that to what purpoſe ſhould I ſupplicate you in theſe things, or importune one that denies us, before he heare us? Only this I muſt ſay; that you ſhew what mercy you mean to uſe to the <hi>Romans,</hi> who have taken Armes againſt you; who reſolve an irreconcileable hatred againſt the <hi>Sicilians,</hi> who never did it. But forbearing Supplications to you, I lift them up to God, who takes vengeance of men that deſpiſe Supplications. <hi>Pelagius</hi> having thus ſaid, went his way.</q>

               <p>THE <hi>Romans</hi> ſeeing <hi>Pelagius</hi> come back without effecting any thing, were much troubled. The Famine grew ſore, albeit the Souldiers Victuall was not yet all ſpent: But the People in multitudes came about <hi>Beſſas,</hi> and <hi>Conon,</hi> weeping and howling, and ſaid thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Our Fortune O Generals is ſuch, that if we could do you any miſchiefe, it were a Crime we could not be blamed for; our extream neceſſity being our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe. But being not able to take revenge, we come to bewaile our Calamity; And heare patiently our bold expreſſion, weighing it by our ſharp Sufferings. They who muſt deſpaire of ſafety, cannot obſerve their duty in words, nor deeds. Think us not <hi>Romans,</hi> nor your Kinſ-men, nor conformable to your State; nor to have chearfully received the Emperours Army, but ancient Enemies, and to have taken Armes againſt you, and to be vanquiſht in fight, and made your Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners by the Law of War. Yet furniſh your Captives with Food, not ſufficient for our need, but ſo much as may keep us alive to do you Service. If you pleaſe
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:50471:121"/>not to do this, yet vouchſafe to manumit us, and free your ſelves from the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of burying your Slaves. If this neither may be afforded, kill us, deprive us not of an honeſt end; envie not to us the ſweeteſt of all deaths, but with one Act de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us from a thouſand miſeries.</q> 
                  <hi>Beſſas,</hi> and <hi>Conon</hi> told them, that to ſupply them with Victuall was not poſſible, to kill them was impious, and to let them go, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe. But they comforted them with an aſſurance of <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> and an Army from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and ſo diſmiſt them. The Famine ſtill grew, and deſtroyed, ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrange unnaturall Food. At firſt <hi>Beſſas</hi> and <hi>Conon,</hi> who had laid up in ſtore a great quantity of Corn for the Souldier, retranched their own allowances, and ſold Corn to the richer ſort at huge rates; a buſhel of Wheat for ſeven Gold Staters. Such whoſe Meanes could not attain to ſo coſtly feeding, paid a fourth part of the price, and had the buſhell fill'd up with Branne, which their hunger made dainty food. An Oxe, ſuch as <hi>Beſſas</hi> Targetiers could get out and take, they ſold for 50. Gold Staters. He was happy that could get a dead Horſe to feed on. The poor multitude fed on Nettles, growing neer the Town Walls, and among the rubbiſh in the City; firſt ſeething them to avoid ſtinging. Such as bought Corn, and Branne, as aforeſaid, when their money was ſpent, brought their Houſhold-ſtuff to the Market-place, and exchanged it for a little daily food. In the end the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers Corn being conſumed, (ſave ſome ſmall quantity which <hi>Beſſas</hi> had) and the <hi>Romans</hi> money ſpent, they all fell to Nettles; which food not ſufficing Nature, and there being of it not enough to fill their bellies, their fleſh pined away, their colour grew wanne, and they lookt like ſo many Ghoſts. Many walking, with their teeth chewing Nettles, fell ſuddainly dead. They did eat alſo one anothers dung, and many, when they could find no more Dogs, nor Rats to feed on, killed themſelves. One having five Children hanging importunately upon him for meat, made no ſhew to lament, but reſtraining his paſſion, he willed the Children to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, and they ſhould have meat. When he came to the Bridge over the <hi>Tiber,</hi> tying his Cloak about his face and eyes, he leapt into the River, his Children and many more looking on. Afterward the Commanders, for money, ſuffered ſuch as would, to go out of the City; ſome few ſtaid, the reſt fled whether they could; the moſt of whom were ſo weak, that they dyed a Ship-board, or upon the high waies. Many the Enemy caught, and kill'd. To this was reduced the Fortune of the People and Senate of <hi>Rome.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>John</hi> being joyned with <hi>Beliſarius</hi> at <hi>Epidamnus, John</hi> adviſed to croſſe the <hi>Jonian</hi> Gulfe, and with the whole Army to try their Fortune by Land. But <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſarius</hi> liked it not; for more time would be ſpent, and ſome impediment might encounter them by Land. He would have <hi>John</hi> march through <hi>Calabria,</hi> and thoſe Countries, to expell the <hi>Goths</hi> being few there; and having ſubdued all on this ſide the Gulfe, to joyne with him about <hi>Rome;</hi> where himſelfe purpoſed to land with the reſt of the Army. He conſidered how the leaſt delay would ruine all at <hi>Rome,</hi> and that in five daies with a wind they might land at <hi>Portus;</hi> whereas from <hi>Otranto</hi> thither, would coſt the Army 40. daies march. So he hoiſt Saile with a ſtrong gale, and came before <hi>Otranto.</hi> The <hi>Goths</hi> ſeeing them, inſtantly raiſed their Seige, and went to <hi>Brunduſium,</hi> ſtanding upon the Gulfe, a daies journey from <hi>Otranto,</hi> with no Walls about it. They advertiſed <hi>Totilas</hi> of it, thinking that <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſarius</hi> would inſtantly paſſe the ſtraits there; who prepared to encounter him, and directed the <hi>Goths</hi> in <hi>Calabria</hi> to guard the Paſſage there: But the wind com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faire, <hi>Beliſarius</hi> left <hi>Otranto,</hi> and the <hi>Goths</hi> were ſecure and quiet in <hi>Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bria.</hi>

                  <hi>Totilas</hi> before <hi>Rome</hi> guarded the Avenues more ſtictly, to keep out Proviſions. He made choice of a place about eleven miles below <hi>Rome</hi> upon the <hi>Tiber,</hi> where it is narroweſt, and there laid a Bridge of Plancks, reaching from one Banck to the other. At either end he built Towers of Wood, and put good Garriſons into them, to impede the paſſage of Barks from <hi>Portus</hi> to <hi>Rome.</hi> In the mean time <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſarius</hi> landed at <hi>Portus,</hi> and attended <hi>Johns</hi> Army. <hi>John</hi> paſt over into <hi>Calabria,</hi> undiſcerned by the <hi>Goths,</hi> who were all at <hi>Brunduſium:</hi> He took two Scouts of the Enemy upon the high way, and having killed the one, the other took him about the knees, and beſought him for mercy, promiſing to be uſefull to him; <hi>John</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded wherein; he ſaid, he would bring him upon the <hi>Goths</hi> unlookt for. <hi>John</hi>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:50471:122"/>told him, he ſhould not then faile in his requeſt; but bad him firſt ſhew him where were any Horſe-paſtures,; The <hi>Goth</hi> promiſing that alſo, went along with him. And firſt ſurpriſing the Enemies Horſes at their Paſture, ſuch as were a foot leapt on them, being many of the beſt men. Then they gallopt to the Enemies Camp, who being unarmed, unprepared, and amazed with the ſuddenneſſe, were moſt of them cut off, uſing no reſiſtence. Some few eſcaped to <hi>Totilas. John</hi> then animated the <hi>Calabrians,</hi> and reconciled their affections to the Emperour with faire promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of many advantages. He ſtaid not in <hi>Brunduſium,</hi> but ſurpriſed <hi>Canuſium,</hi> a Town in the middle of <hi>Apulia,</hi> five daies journey to the Weſtward of <hi>Brunduſium,</hi> in the way to <hi>Rome.</hi> About three miles from this Town is <hi>Cannae,</hi> where <hi>Hanniball</hi> gave that great overthrow to the <hi>Romans.</hi> Here <hi>Tullianus</hi> the Son of <hi>Venantius,</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> of great power in <hi>Bruttia</hi> and <hi>Lucania,</hi> complained to <hi>John</hi> of what the Army had done formerly againſt the <hi>Italians,</hi> and promiſed, if moderation were uſed hereafter, to reduce his Country-men to obedience and payment of Tribute; who revolted unwillingly to <hi>Barbarians</hi> and <hi>Arrians,</hi> forced by them, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly wronged by the Emperours Army. <hi>John</hi> promiſed all favour from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour to the <hi>Italians,</hi> and <hi>Tullianus</hi> went along with him, whence the <hi>Italians</hi> were no more jealous of the Souldiers, and the moſt part of the Country on this ſide the <hi>Jonian</hi> Gulfe became Friends to them, and obedient to the Emperour. <hi>Totilas</hi> upon the newes hereof, ſent 300. <hi>Goths</hi> to <hi>Capua;</hi> whom he directed, when they ſaw <hi>Johns</hi> Army march towards <hi>Rome,</hi> cloſely to follow it. Himſelfe would take care of the reſt: This ſtopt <hi>John,</hi> (fearing to be encompaſt by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy) from marching further towards <hi>Beliſarius;</hi> and he went into <hi>Bruttia</hi> and <hi>Lucania. Recimund</hi> an eminent <hi>Goth,</hi> was placed by <hi>Totilas</hi> with ſome <hi>Goths,</hi> fugitive <hi>Romans,</hi> and <hi>Moores</hi> to guard <hi>Bruttia,</hi> and the ſtraits of <hi>Scylla,</hi> and the Coaſt thereabout, and to hinder the landing of Boats from <hi>Sicily,</hi> &amp; the paſting over thither. <hi>John</hi> ſuddenly fell upon this Army between <hi>Rhegiam</hi> and <hi>Bivona,</hi> and rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them uſing no reſiſtance: They fled towards a Mountain hard of acceſſe and craggy. But <hi>John</hi> ran up with them, and before they could be ſettled in the faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, killed moſt of the <hi>Moores</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers, ſtoutly defending themſelves, and took <hi>Recimund</hi> and the <hi>Goths</hi> upon compoſition. And having thus done, ſtaid in the Country; while <hi>Beliſarius</hi> lay ſtill attending his coming, and blaming him for not adventuring to paſſe by a Garriſon of 300. men in <hi>Capua,</hi> having with him the choice of the Roman Army. But <hi>John</hi> deſpaired of getting by, and lay quiet at <hi>Cervarium,</hi> a place in <hi>Apulia.</hi>

               <p>SO that <hi>Beliſarius</hi> fearing ſome deſperate reſolution of the ſtarving <hi>Romans,</hi> ſtudyed meanes to Victuall the City. Forces he wanted to fight with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy; but he did thus. He tyed two Barks together, upon which he built a Tower of wood, higher then thoſe, which the Enemy had at the Bridge; having by ſome Souldiers, pretending to run away, taken the exact meaſure of them. He lancht into the <hi>Tiber</hi> alſo 200. Pinnaces, having Walls made of boards full of loop-holes, to ſhoot at the Enemy. Aboard the Prinnaces he put Corn and other Proviſions, and towards the Rivers mouth in places of advantage, he laid Horſe and Foot by either Banck, who were to impede the Enemy, if he ſet upon <hi>Portus;</hi> which he committed to the Guard of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> with his Wife, and what he had there, directing him not to ſtir, though he heard <hi>Beliſarius</hi> were ſlain; but to keep cloſe to his Guard, that upon any miſchance, there might be a place of retreat; for other Fortreſſes there was none, all the Country thereabout being their Enemy. Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe aboard one of the Pinnaces, led the reſt; and cauſed the two Barks with the Tower to be towed after. Upon the top of the Tower he put a Cock-boat full of Pitch, Rozin, Brimſtone, and other combuſtible matter upon the Banck, where is the way from <hi>Portus</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> ſtood the Foot. He had ſent the day before to <hi>Beſſas,</hi> to make a generall Sally, and to alarm the Enemies Camp. The like he had directed
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:50471:122"/>him often before, but neither before nor now, would he perform his directions: for he had Corn yet for his own uſe left, ſent formerly by the Governours of <hi>Sicily,</hi> ſufficient both for the Souldier and the People. Of this he gave little to the People, but took moſt of it upon the account of the Army, and kept it to himſelfe, ſelling it at huge rates to the Senators: So that he had no mind to have the Seige raiſed. But <hi>Beliſarius</hi> rowed up the River with a ſtrong ſtream againſt him: The <hi>Goths</hi> lying quiet in their Trenches. Neer the Bridge they came to a Guard of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and found an Iron Chaine faſtned from Banck to Banck, which <hi>Totilas</hi> had put there, to hinder the paſſage to the Bridge. They ſhot, and killed ſome, and frighted away the reſt, then took up the Chain and rowed on to the Bridge, where they fell to work; The <hi>Goths,</hi> valiantly defending from their Towers, and many running in from the Camp. Then <hi>Beliſarius</hi> brought his two Barks with the Tower on them cloſe to the Enemies Tower, which ſtood into the water by the way from <hi>Portus.</hi> He cauſed them to fire the Cock-boat, and to ſhoove it down juſt upon the Enemies Tower, which inſtantly fell afire, and burnt with it ſelfe 200. <hi>Goths</hi> within it, and their Commander, one of the valianteſt of the Nation. Mean while the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhot ſo thick upon the ſeconds which came from the Camp, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo amazed at the Accident, they ran all away. The <hi>Romans</hi> laid hands on the Bridge, and had ſuddenly pulled it down, and gotten into <hi>Rome,</hi> none oppoſing; But Fortune was not ſo pleaſed. Some envious <hi>Daemon</hi> plotted that, which ruined the <hi>Romans</hi> Affaires. The Armies being thus employed, the report (to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> miſchiefe) came to <hi>Portus,</hi> how <hi>Beliſarius</hi> had taken up the Chain, and killed the <hi>Goths</hi> there. <hi>Iſaac</hi> could not hold, but would have his ſhare in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; and fogetting <hi>Beliſarius</hi> Commands, he went haſtily to the other ſide of the River where <hi>Oſtia</hi> ſtands, and with a 100. Horſe of the men left him by <hi>Beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarius,</hi> he charged the Enemies quarter commanded by <hi>Roderick</hi> a skilfull Souldier. And coming ſuddenly, he wounded many, and <hi>Roderick</hi> himſelfe and the <hi>Goths</hi> quitted their Quarter, either ſuſpecting more to be coming after <hi>Iſaac,</hi> or decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him, to ſurpriſe his Troops, which happened. For <hi>Iſaac</hi> entring the Enemies Trenches, and falling to pillage, the <hi>Goths</hi> returned, killed many, and took him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and others Priſoners. Some Horſe-men gallopt to <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> and reported that <hi>Iſaac</hi> was taken by the Enemy; Who aſtoniſht with the newes, and not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring the manner, but thinking <hi>Portus</hi> and his Wife to be loſt, and all ruined, and how no Fortreſſe was now left for the Army to retire to, he had not a word to ſay, a thing never happening to him before: And immediately he drew back his Forces, meaning to charge the Enemy unprepared, and by all meanes to recover the place; And thus the <hi>Romans</hi> retired without doing any thing. But <hi>Beliſarius</hi> when at <hi>Portus</hi> he found the raſhneſſe of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and perceived his own Counſell perturbation, the vexation of it, and at the croſſe Fortune put him into a Feaver, which afflicted him long, and brought him to deaths door. Two daies after <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi> dyed, which ſo grieved <hi>Totilas,</hi> that he put <hi>Iſaac</hi> to death. But <hi>Beſſas</hi> ſtil trading with his Corn, grew rich, hunger and neceſſity ſetting the priſes for him. His whole thoughts were upon it, neglecting the Guard of the Walls or any thing tending to preſervation; and the Souldiers might be as negligent as they pleaſed. Upon the Walls were ſmall Guards, and thoſe not attended. The Sentinels might ſleep ſecurely, none ever viſiting them, to call them to an account, nor going the round, as is uſuall. And the Citizens being few left, and they almoſt ſtarved, would not keep any Watch. At laſt foure <hi>Iſaurians,</hi> who ſtood Sentinels neer <hi>Porta Aſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naria,</hi> at the time of night, when their turn came to watch, and their fellowes to ſleep, ſlipt down the Walls by Ropes tyed to the Battlements, and came to <hi>Toti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi> undertaking to receive his Army into the City with eaſe: <hi>Totilas</hi> promiſed many Favours, and to make them rich if they performed it, and ſent two Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers with them to view the place, where they ſaid the City might be entred. They came to the Wall, mounted the Battlements by the Ropes; not a man ſpeaking, nor taking notice. Being there, the <hi>Iſaurians</hi> ſhewed them how nothing would oppoſe their coming up, nor encounter them being up; which they bad them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to <hi>Totilas;</hi> who though he was glad of the report, yet he could not truſt them, being <hi>Iſaurians.</hi> Not many daies after they came again, urging him upon the ſame buſineſſe, and he ſent two others, who examined all exactly, and made
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:50471:123"/>their report, agreeing with the former. In the meane time ſome <hi>Roman</hi> Scouts met ten <hi>Goths</hi> neer the City upon the high-way, whom they took, and brought to <hi>Beſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſas:</hi> Who by enquiry learnt of them, that <hi>Totilas</hi> hope was to have the City betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him by <hi>Iſaurians. Beſſas</hi> and <hi>Conon</hi> made ſlight of the advertiſement; and the <hi>Iſaurians</hi> coming the third time to <hi>Totilas,</hi> and he ſending others, and one of his own Kinred with them, and they reporting ſtill the ſame, he reſolved the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize.</p>

               <p>THE ſame night he ſilently armed his forces, and led them to <hi>Porta Aſinaria,</hi> willing four <hi>Goths</hi> valiant and ſtrong to mount the Battlements with the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaurians,</hi> at the houre when they were to watch, and the reſt were to go to bed in their turns. They being gotten into the Towne, went to <hi>Porta A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinaria</hi> without meeting any; and with their Battleaxes cut in two the Timber poſts upon which the Gates on each ſide hung, and wrench'd off the iron worke where-into the Watch-men put their keyes to open and ſhut then: And ſo having ſet them open, they received in <hi>Totilas</hi> and the Army. <hi>Totilas</hi> drew all to one place, not ſuffering them to ſcatter, affraid of ſome ambuſh from the Enemy. The City ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly was full of tumult, and moſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers fled with their Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders out at another gate. Some took Sanctuary with other <hi>Romans</hi> in Churches. Of the Patricians, <hi>Decius, Baſilius,</hi> and ſome others fled out with <hi>Beſſas,</hi> having Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; but <hi>Maximus, Olybrius, Oreſtes</hi> and others fled into St. <hi>Peters</hi> Church. Of the commons remained but 500. men, who took Sanctuary alſo, the reſt were all gone away, or ſtarved. <hi>Totilas</hi> being told in the night, that <hi>Beſſas</hi> and the Enemy were running away, ſayd, they brought him very good news, and that they ſhould not follow them; For what ſhould pleaſe a man mare then his Enemies running away? In the morning <hi>Totilas</hi> ſuſpecting now no Ambuſh, went to St. <hi>Peters</hi> Church to Prayer: But the <hi>Goths</hi> killed ſome in their way, about 26. Souldiers, and ſixty Commons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Totilas</hi> being in the Church, <hi>Pelagius</hi> came a ſuppliant to him with the Goſpels in his hand, crying out, <hi>O ſpare, my Lord! your owne people.</hi> Now (quoth <hi>Totilas,</hi> ſcoffing) you come an humble Petitioner to me; Becauſe God hath made me your ſlave, replyed <hi>Pelagius. And now, O Maſter! ſpare your owne ſlaves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Totilas</hi> wonne with his ſupplications, for bad the <hi>Goths</hi> to kill any more; but to make booty of their Goods, reſerving the moſt precious for himſelfe. They found much wealth in the <hi>Patricians</hi> houſes, but moſt in the lodging of <hi>Beſſas,</hi> who had heaped up thoſe wicked prices of his Corn for <hi>Totilas:</hi> The <hi>Romans,</hi> even Senators, and <hi>Ruſticiana</hi> the Widow of <hi>Boetius,</hi> and daughter of <hi>Symmachus</hi> (a woman that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver laid out her Revenues upon the poor) went begging their bread of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; wandring from houſe to houſe, knocking at the doors, and craving ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance without bluſhing.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Goths</hi> indeavoured to put <hi>Ruſticiana</hi> to death, for bribing the <hi>Roman</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders to break down <hi>Theodericks</hi> Images, in revenge of her Husbands and Fathers deaths: But <hi>Totilas</hi> preſerved her, and protected all the Women from the Souldiers inſolence, who were eager to raviſh them; but not one was abuſed: For which his modeſty <hi>Totilas</hi> got a great reputation. The next day he aſſembled the <hi>Goths,</hi> and ſpake thus;</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Fellow Souldiers! I call you together, not to make any new exhortations, but the ſame I have given formerly, and by entertayning which, you have found your greateſt good: And do not now to this hearken careleſly. Adviſes conducting you to happineſſe ſhould never be tedious, nor many words ſeeme weariſome, ſince the fruits ſpringing from them muſt not weary you. I ſay then againe, that the other day we had 200000. valiant fighting men together, were maſters of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wealth, had abundance of Horſes, and other preparations, and many wiſe old men, who in Warre are of greateſt uſe. Yet were we beaten by 7000. <hi>Greeks,</hi> and ſenſeleſly deprived of our Empire, and all things elſe. But now being reduced
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:50471:123"/>to few, and thoſe naked, poore, and unexperienced, we have vanquiſh'd the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy; being upward of 20000. men. The cauſe of this our ſucceſſe I will tell you, though you know it already. The <hi>Goths</hi> then not valuing Juſtice, acted foule wrongs upon themſelves, and their <hi>Roman</hi> Subjects: Which moved God (as could not otherwiſe be) to fight againſt them for the Enemie: Whom wee exceeding in numbers, valour, and other preparations, yet were we beaten by an unſeen power. It is now in your power to keep your proſperity by keeping your juſtice. If you change, God will be your Enemy: Who aſſiſts not this or that race, or Nation, but the men to whom Juſtice is precious: In him it is no labour to transferr proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity from one to another. Let man only reſolve never to do wrong; To God all things naturally are in his free power. Obſerve therefore juſtice, and you ſhall for ever maintain your happineſſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Having ſaid thus to the <hi>Goths,</hi> he called the <hi>Roman</hi> Senators to him, and bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproacht them; That having received benefits from <hi>Theoderick</hi> and <hi>Atala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi> been employed in all offices, managed the whole State, and made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves rich; they had proved ungratefull to their Benefactors, by unworthily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volting to their own miſchiefe, and had betrayed themſelves by bringing <hi>Greeks</hi> into their Countrey. He urged them to ſay, what hurt the <hi>Goths,</hi> or what benefit the Emperour <hi>Juſtinian</hi> had done them. They were deprived of almoſt all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, wrung and tortured by the publique Tax-gatherers to accompt for their carriages towards the <hi>Goths</hi> in the Treaſury: And being ſpoiled by the Warr, yet the <hi>Greeks</hi> made them pay their tributes, as in the times of Peace.</q>
               </p>
               <p>He objected many ſuch things, as angry Maſters uſe to their new made ſlaves. Then pointing to <hi>Herodian,</hi> and the four <hi>Iſaurians:</hi> 
                  <q>You, quoth he, having been bred with us, could never yeeld up to us ſo much as one forſaken Town: but theſe have received us into <hi>Spoletum,</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelfe. Be you therefore in the condition of ſlaves, and theſe who have been friends, and as Countrey-men to us, ſhall have your offices.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Patricians</hi> ſtood ſilent at theſe words: But <hi>Pelagius</hi> interceded for them, as men ruined and unfortunate, till <hi>Totilas</hi> promiſed mercy, and let them goe. He ſent <hi>Pelagius,</hi> and <hi>Theodorus,</hi> an Orator of <hi>Rome,</hi> to <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> his Ambaſſadors, making them ſweare to deale fairly, and to return into <hi>Italy</hi> ſo ſoon as they could: He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed them to perſwade the Emperour to make peace, otherwiſe hee ſhould be compelled to lay <hi>Rome</hi> flat with the ground, to kill all the Senate, and to bring the War into <hi>Illyrium;</hi> And he wrote letters to the Emperor; who had the news alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the ſucceſſes in <hi>Italy.</hi> When they came to him, they declared their inſtructions from <hi>Totilas,</hi> and preſented his letter, of this tenor.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>You are fully advertiſed what hath happened to <hi>Rome,</hi> I doubt it not. But my reaſon of this Embaſſage is, to crave of you to entertaine the bleſſings of Peace your ſelfe, and to permit them to us. Whereof we have a faire precedent in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtaſius</hi> and <hi>Theodericke:</hi> Who reigned together not long ſince; but they filled their Reigns with Peace and good things. If you be pleaſed to do the like, I will call you my Father, and you ſhall have the <hi>Goths</hi> your Auxiliaries againſt whom you pleaſe.</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Juſtinian</hi> read the Letter, and heard the Ambaſſadors, but inſtantly ſent them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with this anſwer in writing to <hi>Totilas:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That he had made <hi>Beliſarius</hi> abſolute Generall in this Warr, who had ful pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to manage all things concerning <hi>Totilas</hi> as he pleaſed.</q> During this voyage of the Ambaſſadors to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and back again, <hi>Tullianus</hi> in <hi>Lucania</hi> leavyed ſome Peaſants, and guarded the Straits there, to hinder the Enemies entring to infeſt <hi>Lucania;</hi> With him were 300. <hi>Antians,</hi> left with him by <hi>John;</hi> being of all <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> the apteſt to fight in a faſtneſſe. <hi>Totilas</hi> thought it not fit to employ all the <hi>Goths</hi> againſt them; But he ſent numbers of Peaſants in the company of ſome <hi>Goths,</hi> whom he commanded to attempt the paſſage. They fought, and much ſtirring there was, but by the valour of the <hi>Antians,</hi> and favour of the faſtneſſe, <hi>Tullianus</hi> in the end routed them.</p>

                  <hi>TOtilas</hi> hearing of it, reſolved to demoliſh <hi>Rome,</hi> and leaving part of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in ſome towne thereabout with the reſt to go againſt <hi>John</hi> and the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canians.</hi> He threw downe about the third part of the walls of <hi>Rome,</hi> and was ready to fire the faireſt, and moſt eminent buildings, and to make <hi>Rome</hi> a ſheepe paſture; but <hi>Beliſarius</hi> advertized of his intention, ſent Ambaſſadors to him, and wrote him this Letter, <q>It hath been the invention of wiſe men of old, affecting civility, to raiſe goodly buildings; and none deſtroy them but ſome dull men, not aſhamed to leave to poſterity ſuch a mark of their diſpoſition. And of all Cities under the Sun, <hi>Rome</hi> is confeſt to be the greateſt and moſt famous; being not the work of one mans virtue, nor arrived to this beauty and bigneſſe in a ſmall time. Many Emperours and excellent men, length of time, and exceſſe of wealth have drawn together materialls from all countries, and rare artificers, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo by little and little built the City as you now ſee it, they have filled it with monuments of all their virtues, and the violence done to the ſame is an injury committed againſt all mankind; taking from our progenitors the memorialls of their worth, and from poſterity the ſight of ſuch goodly works. Know then, that one of the two muſt be, either you will be vanquiſht by the Emperour, or get the better. If you be victorious, by having deſtroyed <hi>Rome;</hi> you have ruined, Great Sir, not anothers, but your own; by preſerving which, you will be rich in the goodlieſt poſſeſſion in the world. But if you draw the looſing lot; having preſerved <hi>Rome,</hi> you have reſerved abundant thanks from the conquerour: But by deſtroying it, bereft your ſelf of all pretence to favour. And you will get no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by it, but a fame in the world ſutable to ſuch a proceeding, which attends your Reſolution herein either way. Whatſoever the actions of Princes be, ſuch are neceſſarily the name they muſt bear from them.</q> 
                  <hi>Totilas</hi> upon often reading this Letter, and pondring the adviſe, forbare further harme to <hi>Rome.</hi> and ſignifying to <hi>Beliſarius</hi> his determination, he diſmiſt the Ambaſſadors: He encamped moſt of his army at <hi>Algidum,</hi> 15 miles from <hi>Rome</hi> to the Weſtward, to ly there and keep <hi>Beliſarius</hi> faſt in <hi>Portus,</hi> and himſelf and the reſt went againſt <hi>John</hi> and the <hi>Lucani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> Some Roman Senators he led with him, and the reſt with their wives and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren he ſent to <hi>Campania,</hi> leaving not a man in <hi>Rome. John</hi> hearing of <hi>Totilas</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, would ſtay no longer in <hi>Apulia,</hi> but ran into <hi>Otranto.</hi> The Patricians confined in <hi>Campania,</hi> ſent commands by <hi>Totilas</hi> direction to their husbandmen of <hi>Lucania,</hi> to leave <hi>John,</hi> and to manure their Lands as formerly, which were declared to belong to their Landlords. Whereupon they forſook <hi>John,</hi> and went and lived peaceably at home. <hi>Tullianus</hi> alſo ran away, and his 300 <hi>Antians</hi> retired to <hi>Johns</hi> army.

               <p>BUt <hi>Beliſarius</hi> undertook a deſign provident and bold, which ſeemed a kinde of madneſſe at firſt, but proved a gallant work. He left a ſmall Garriſon in <hi>Portus,</hi> and with the reſt of his army he went into <hi>Rome</hi> with a reſolution to hold it. He could not in ſo ſhort a time repaire the walls, demoliſhed by <hi>Toti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las;</hi> but he heaped ſtones one upon another rudely, without lime or the like between, only to give it the form of a wall; without it he pitcht good ſtore of ſtakes; And a ditch he had formerly made round about, as I ſaid before. The whole army wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king cheerfully, in five and twenty daies the breaches were filled up.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> from the townes about flocked thither, aſwell deſiring to dwell in <hi>Rome</hi> again, as to be ſupplyed with Victuall which they wanted, and found there in abundance, imported by <hi>Beliſarius</hi> up the River. <hi>Totilas</hi> at the newes, went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly thitherward; <hi>Beliſarius</hi> having not yet ſet up the Gates, which <hi>Totilas</hi> had broken down; and he for want of Artificers, could not build them again. The <hi>Barbarian</hi> Army encamped by the River of <hi>Tiber,</hi> and there lodged that night; the next morning they marcht furiouſly to the City-walls. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> placed, where the Gates had ſtood, ſome of his beſt men, and commanded the reſt from the Walls to maintain fight againſt the Aſſailants, and it was hotly fought; For the <hi>Goths,</hi> who hoped to take the Town at the firſt on-ſet, finding the buſineſſe prove tough, and the <hi>Romans</hi> powerfully defending, grew angry, and their anger made them more ventrous. The <hi>Romans</hi> alſo held out beyond expectation, the danger indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them to be valiant. The Slaughter was great of the <hi>Goths,</hi> being annoyed by ſhot from the Walls. Both the Armies toyled hard, the Fight beginning in the morning, and ending at night. When it grew dark, the <hi>Goths</hi> returned to their Quarters, and ſpent the night in dreſſing their wounded men. The <hi>Romans</hi> kept Guards upon the Walls, and put the beſt men where the Gates had been, to guard by turnes, having pitcht before them many <hi>Triboli,</hi> that the Enemy might not ride in upon them. The <hi>Triboli,</hi> or <hi>Gall-traps</hi> are of this Faſhion. They fit to one another the blunt ends of foure Iron ſprigs, of equall length, whoſe right lines make a triangle every way. Theſe they throw upon the ground, and three of them ſtick faſt; the other ſtand upright, and hinders the approach of horſe and men: and if by chance they be turned over, the point that ſtood up before, pitches into the Ground, and another gets up inſtead of it, hindring a charging Enemy. But the next morning <hi>Totilas</hi> again aſſaulted, and the <hi>Romans</hi> defended in their former or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, got the better, and growing bold ſallied; and ſome chaſing the retiring Enemy far from the Town, the <hi>Goths</hi> fell to compaſſe them, and to cut off their retreate; which <hi>Beliſarius</hi> perceiving, ſent out ſome of his own company, who brought them off:
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:50471:125"/>And the <hi>Goths</hi> repulſed, retired with loſſe of many of their beſt men, and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off many wounded. They kept cloſe in their Quarters, dreſſing their hurt-men, and mending their Armes (which were much ſpoyled) and making other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations. Many daies after they aſſaulted again, and the <hi>Romans</hi> killed the Enſigne-bearer of <hi>Totilas,</hi> who being deadly wounded, and falling, threw away his Enſigne. The <hi>Romans</hi> in the Van ran for it, and to ſtrip the dead body: But the <hi>Goths</hi> took up the Enſigne, and cut off the dead mans left Arme, and carryed it off, having a rich Bracelet of Gold on it, which they thought would be an affront to them, if ſome vaunting Enemy ſhould weare it; And then they made a diſorderly retreat. The <hi>Romans</hi> followed the Execution a good way, ſtript the reſt of the dead bodies, and came into the City without loſſe of a man. The principall <hi>Goths</hi> reproached <hi>Totilas</hi> ſomething licentiouſly, for his unadviſedneſſe, in not demoliſhing all <hi>Rome</hi> when he took it, (that no Enemy might hold it) or in not keeping it himſelfe; but in thus ruining, what they had effected with much toile and time. Thus men ever tune their Judgments to the Events of things, and yeild up the ſame to the ſtream of Fortune, from thence taking quick and ſudden changes of Opinion. The <hi>Goths,</hi> when <hi>Totilas</hi> proſpered, admired him like a God; calling him unreſiſtible, invincible, as they did before, when he ſuffered them to deſtroy part of the Cities Walls which they took: But no ſooner he received a blow, but they ſhameleſſely raile on him, fogetting their former words, and contradicting themſelves without reaſon. But ſuch Errours being the effects of nature, it is not poſſible for men not to commit them. But <hi>Totilas</hi> raiſed his Seige, and went to the City <hi>Tibur,</hi> break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the Bridges upon the <hi>Tiber,</hi> that the Enemy might not charge him. <hi>Pons Milvius,</hi> a Bridge neer to <hi>Rome,</hi> they could not demoliſh. They re-built the Caſtle of <hi>Tibur,</hi> which they had caſt down before, and kept themſelves quiet within it, and all their Baggage. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> ſet up the Gates of <hi>Rome</hi> at his eaſe, lining them with Iron; and he ſent the Keyes again to the Emperour: And ſo ended the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the 12. yeare of this War, written by <hi>Procopius.</hi>

                  <q>Fellow Souldiers, ſeeing you are cauſeleſly angry with me, and do pine at our late croſſe Fortune; I now call you together, to rectifie your Opinion, and to ſettle your Judgments aright; leaſt you appeare not only unthankfull to me, but fooliſhly to uſe ingratitude even to God himſelfe. Humane things are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to miſchances, and he, that being but a man, yet takes ſuch things in ill part, ſhall neceſſarily be thought to want wit, and yet nevertheleſſe undergo the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of his Fortune. I will put you in mind of former proceedings, not ſo much to excuſe theſe now, as to ſhew that they ought rather to be commended. In the beginning of the War <hi>Vitigas</hi> demoliſht the Walls of <hi>Fanus</hi> and <hi>Penſau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> maritime Townes, letting <hi>Rome</hi> and all the other Cities in <hi>Italy</hi> ſtand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defaced. And from <hi>Fanus</hi> &amp; <hi>Penſaurum</hi> we have had no inconvenience; but from <hi>Rome,</hi> and the other fortified places, our Affaires have ſucceeded as you know. When by your Gift I received this Government, I choſe rather to follow the beſt courſes, then by the contrary to hurt you; ſince naturally men differ not much, but experience is it, which makes the good Schollers of her Schoole in all things better, then they who learn not of her. So that taking <hi>Beneventum</hi> we threw down the Walls, and were preſently Maſters of the reſt, whoſe Walls we alſo demoliſht: That we might not have our Enemies ever iſſuing from Fortreſſes, and making the War with Artifices, but to come directly to a Feild, and there to fight it out. And there they ran away, and their Cities which I took, I diſman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telled, and you then were the Admirers, and Miniſters of that my reſolution, and made the work (as it was indeed) your own; ſeeing he who commends a man for an Act, is himſelfe an Actor. But now you are changed, ſince a bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe without reaſon taken by <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> hath ſucceeded; and now you are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of the man, being ſo valiant. Indeed fool-hardy men are ſooner thought to be courageous, then the provident, to be cautious. He that adventures more
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:50471:125"/>then the occaſion allowes, is honoured yet with a reputation of ſeeming Valour; But he that upon a provident conſideration is apprehenſive of the danger, and then failes, drawes upon himſelfe the blame of all that happens. And if it ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed well, unskilfull men will not think that he dath done any thing in it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, you conſider not how you are offended with me, for what I rather may take ill of you. Is it now only that <hi>Beliſarius</hi> hath gotten honour upon you? Who being his Captives, and fugitive Slaves, took Armes under me, and have gotten the better of him in this War? And if by my virtue you have effected this, you ſhould be patient and conſider in miſchances, that nothing is made to be ever the ſame. And Fortune having adjudged to you the Victory, you ſhall do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to reverence the ſame, then to be peeviſh againſt it; leaſt it be offended, and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For how can that be a good nature, that having lately attempted great Fortunes, and now failed in a ſmall matter, is ſo poorly dejected? This is plainly to renounce your ſelves to be men; for never to ſlip is peculiar to God alone. So that ſetting by theſe things, I ſay, that you are to go to <hi>Peruſia,</hi> and to encounter the Enemy: If you conquer them, Fortune will cleare up again. No age can make that undone, which hath happened to us; but the memory of ill Fortunes is aſwaged by the arrivall of good. The getting <hi>Peruſia</hi> will coſt little labour; <hi>Cyprianus</hi> the Commander, Fortune and our Counſels have removed; and a multitude without a Governour, and without Victuals too, are no fit men to fight valiantly. None ſhall infeſt your backs, I having beaten down the Bridges to prevent any ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den incurſions. <hi>Beliſarius</hi> likewiſe and <hi>John</hi> are jealous of one another, as may appeare by their Actions, (which ever convince the diſagreement of minds) they to this day having never joyned their Forces, by reaſon of their mutuall jealouſie. And that Gueſt whoſoever hath, may be ſure of hatred and envie in the ſame lodging, which being intermingled, nothing can poſſibly be done that ſhould be.</q> Having thus ſpoken, he led the Army towards <hi>Peruſia,</hi> and there fate down before it, preparing for a Siege.</p>

               <p>IN the mean time <hi>John</hi> beſieged the Caſtle of <hi>Acherontis,</hi> and finding that he could do no good upon it, he fell upon a bold reſolution, which preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſome <hi>Roman</hi> Senators, and got much reputation to himſelfe. While <hi>Totilas</hi> was buſie before <hi>Rome,</hi> he took to himſelfe a party of choice Horſe-men, and concealing his intent, made a journey into <hi>Campania</hi> (where <hi>Totilas</hi> had confined the Senators) reſting neither day nor night, that coming ſuddenly he might reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue the Senators, the Townes being altogether unfortified. <hi>Totilas</hi> before fearing this, and that by ſome Enemy he might loſe his Priſoners, had ſent into <hi>Campania</hi> ſome Forces of Horſe; who being come to the City of <hi>Minturnae,</hi> thought it beſt to ſtay there, and to reſt their Horſes, being weary with the journey. Some others <hi>Totilas</hi> had directed, (being men in much account with him, and about 400.) to view in what Eſtate <hi>Capua</hi> was, and the Townes about it; And the journey thither was but 37. miles, and the Horſes of theſe and themſelves were freſh and luſty. It happened that theſe 400, and <hi>John</hi> arrived at the ſame day and houre at <hi>Capua,</hi> not knowing of one anothers coming. Suddenly a gallant fight was performed, both parties falling to it at firſt ſight, wherein the <hi>Romans</hi> had the abſolute Victory, and killed many; ſome few of them got away, and gallopt to <hi>Minturnae;</hi> whom the others there ſeeing all bloody, and ſome with Arrowes ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them, others not ſo much as telling them what had befallen them, (ſo earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt they were to get away) and bewraying the feare they were in, they alſo leapt upon their Horſes and ran with them for company: And coming to <hi>Totilas,</hi> they told him of innumerable Enemies, to ſave the ſhame of their running away. Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers then came into <hi>John,</hi> who were quartered in <hi>Campania;</hi> And ſome few Senators he found there, but almoſt all their Wives. For moſt of the men at the taking of <hi>Rome,</hi> were fled into <hi>Portus</hi> with the Souldiers, but all the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:50471:126"/>Women were taken Priſoners. One <hi>Clementinus</hi> a <hi>Patritian,</hi> fled into a Church, not accompanying the <hi>Roman</hi> Army; becauſe having betrayed a Caſtle neer unto <hi>Naples</hi> to <hi>Totilas,</hi> he feared the Emperours indignation. <hi>Oreſtes</hi> alſo, who had been Conſull, ſtaid at his houſe for want of Horſes to carry him away; <hi>John</hi> ſent the Senators he found, and the 70. Souldiers into <hi>Sicily:</hi> But <hi>Totilas</hi> was vexed at this newes, and eager to have his revenge upon <hi>John;</hi> And he marcht againſt him, leaving only ſome of his Troops to guard the Camp before <hi>Peruſia: John</hi> had encamped his 100. men in <hi>Lucania,</hi> and ſent out ſome to diſcover upon all the waies, that the Enemy might not ſurpriſe him. And <hi>Totilas</hi> gueſting as much, and that <hi>John</hi> would not lye in his Camp, without his Scouts abroad; left the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary wayes, and marcht over the Mountaines which were many, high and craggy, and thought unpaſſable, that none would ſuſpect his coming that way. <hi>Johns</hi> Scouts found the Enemy was thereabout, but no certainty they could learn; and fearing what came to paſſe, they rode back to their Camp, and with them arrived there the <hi>Goths</hi> in the night, <hi>Totilas</hi> being in a rage, and ſo not well adviſed, had the fruit of his impertinet anger. His Army was ten times greater then his Enemies; and it is evidently beſt for a ſtronger Army to make an open fight; ſo that he ſhould have charged the Enemy in the morning (to take from them the benefit of the dark to hide themſelves) and ſo he had taken them all as in a net. But he giving way to his anger, ſet on them in the dark night. They uſed no reſiſtance, being taken moſt of them aſleep; yet the <hi>Goths</hi> killed not many, they having the means in the dark to ſlip away unſeen, leaving their camp, and running up to the next mountains. <hi>John</hi> eſcaped amongſt the reſt, and <hi>Aruſus,</hi> Captaine of the <hi>Herulians.</hi> Almoſt 100. <hi>Romans</hi> were ſlaine: There was with <hi>John</hi> one <hi>Gilacius</hi> an <hi>Armenian,</hi> commanding ſome few of his Countrey-men, who ſpake neither <hi>Greeke, Latine,</hi> nor <hi>Gothiſh,</hi> but <hi>Armenian</hi> only; ſome <hi>Goths</hi> lighting upon him, ask'd him who he was: (They forbare to kill any in the dark, leſt they might kill their owne) He could make no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther anſwer, but that he was Generall <hi>Gilacius,</hi> having learnt the title of his place in <hi>Greek,</hi> by hearing it often named. The <hi>Goths</hi> finding him an Enemy, took him Priſoner, and ſoon after killed him. <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Aruſus</hi> with their troops gallop't amain to <hi>Otranto:</hi> And the <hi>Goths</hi> afterward pillaging the <hi>Romans</hi> Camp, retired.</p>

               <p>THE Horſe ſent by <hi>Beliſarius</hi> met Forces of the Enemy ſent by <hi>Totilas</hi> to attempt that Caſtle: With theſe they fought, and though much inferiour in numbers, they routed them, and killed above 200. The reſt ran away to <hi>Totilas</hi> with the newes. The <hi>Romans</hi> encamped in the place; and being ill governed, and victorious, lived careleſly, neither lying together in one body, nor keeping guards upon the two paſſages; but lodging too ſecurely farr aſunder, and all the day ſtragling for Proviſions, without ſending out Scouts, or adviſing upon any courſe of ſafety. <hi>Totilas</hi> being thereof advertiſed, went againſt them with 3000. choſen Horſemen: And coming unlooked for upon them, being in no order to fight, but ſtragling, he amazed and routed them. <hi>Pharas</hi> encountred the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and did valiantly; whereby ſome eſcaped, but himſelfe, and his company were ſlain.

               </p>
               <p>About this time an Army of <hi>Slavonians</hi> paſſed the River <hi>Iſter,</hi> and did infinite miſchiefe in <hi>Illyrium,</hi> even to <hi>Epidamnus,</hi> killing and captivating all and of all ages they found, and taking the ſpoile.

               <p>In that Winter were many terrible Earth-quakes in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and elſe-where, all in the night; that the Inhabitants feared to be over-whelmed, but no hurt was done.

But now a great number of <hi>Daulphins</hi> coming upon the mouth of the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea, and eſpying the whale, fled from him, the moſt of them to the mouth of <hi>Sangaris,</hi> where the Whale overtook ſome of them, and devoured them: But either hunger or anger provoking him to purſue neer the ſhore, he fell into the mud, where tumbling and ſtriving, hee was more engaged; and the Inhabitants hearing of it, ran downe, and hewed him with their Axes; but not being able to kill him, they drew him aſhore, with great ropes, laying him upon Waynes, and found him thirty cubits long, and ten broad. They cut him in pieces, and ſome preſently eate them, others pickled them up. The newes of the over-flowing of <hi>Nile,</hi> and this Whale, added to the Earth-quake which they had felt, filled the <hi>Conſtantinopolitans</hi> with propheſies of ſtrange events; Men uſing ſtill in preſent perplexities, and diſturbances to make groundleſſe conjectures of things to come.</p>

                  <hi>BELISARI<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi> ſent then for <hi>John</hi> to <hi>Otranto,</hi> and with him, and <hi>Valeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus,</hi> and a Fleet he had got together, he ſailed to ſuccour <hi>Ruſciana.</hi> The Garriſon there diſcerning the Fleet, took courage, and refuſed to yeild, though the day aſſigned were at hand.

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:50471:127"/>about to Sea-ward, and came again to an Anchor in the haven of <hi>Croton:</hi> Where they reſolved in counſell, that <hi>Beliſarius</hi> ſhould make for <hi>Rome,</hi> and Victual it, as he could; and that <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Valerianus</hi> ſhould land, and ride into <hi>Picenia,</hi> to impede the Enemies ſieges of the Towns there; hoping alſo to draw <hi>Totilas</hi> towards them, with the raiſing of the ſiege of <hi>Ruſciana. John</hi> with his Troops being 1000. men, did accordingly: But <hi>Valerianus</hi> was afraid, and by the <hi>Jonian</hi> Gulfe ſailed for <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cona,</hi> thinking ſo more ſecurely to get into <hi>Picenia,</hi> to joyn with <hi>John.

The Souldiers that would, he kept in equall ranck with <hi>Goths,</hi> and left them their goods (as he uſed in all places) And ſuch as would not, he diſmiſt, ſtript, and unarmed, not deſiring any to ſerve him unwillingly: And 80. of them quitted their goods, and came to <hi>Croton;</hi> the reſt ſtaid; of whom the <hi>Italians</hi> had their goods taken away afterwards, but no hurt was done to their perſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antonina</hi> finding the Empreſſe dead at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> beſought the Emperour to ſend for her Husband home: Which ſhe eaſily obtained, the <hi>Perſian</hi> War preſſing ſore. In the mean time there was an attempt againſt the Emperours perſon, which began, and was defeated in this manner. <hi>Artabanes,</hi> who ſlew the Tyrant <hi>Gontharis</hi> in <hi>Affrick,</hi> was eager to marry <hi>Projecta,</hi> the Emperours ſiſters daughter; He was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troathed to her, and ſhe affected the match; not for love of his perſon ſo much, as in her gratitude to a man, who had revenged the murder of her Husband <hi>Areobin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> and reſcued her a Captive, and ready to be put into the loathed bed of <hi>Gontha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> the Tyrant. Both thus conſenting, <hi>Artabanes</hi> ſent <hi>Projecta</hi> to the Emperour; and being made Generall of <hi>Africk,</hi> beſought the Emperour with ſome pretences, to ſend for him to <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> Hoping thereby to effect the marriage, and to get many advantages, and even to put for the Empire.</p>
               <p>Men thus getting fortunes which they looked not for, yet look ſtill further; and foment their riſing hopes, till they fall from the happineſſe they have. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour granted his deſire, and ſent for him to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and made another Generall of <hi>Africke,</hi> as is ſaid in my former relations. And being a tall comely perſonage, liberall, and of few words, the <hi>Conſtantinopolitans</hi> loved him, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired him for his deeds. And the Emperour reſpected him with the beſt, made him Generall of the Forces in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and Commander of the Confederates, and enrolled him a Conſull. But he could not marry <hi>Projecta,</hi> by reaſon he had a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Wife, his Country-woman, whom he married young, and ſhook off long before upon ſome exceptions for ſlight matters, wherein women offend their Husbands. And ſhe, while <hi>Artabanes</hi> fortunes were not yet made, ſate quiet at home; But he being grown famous for his Actions, and great in his fortunes, ſhe would ſuffer no longer the diſhonour; but became ſutor in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to the Empreſſe for her Husband to be reſtored to her. The Empreſſe, ever inclinable to aſſiſt diſtreſſed women, brought her to live with her Husband, much againſt his will: And <hi>Proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta</hi> was married to <hi>John,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Pompey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Artabanes</hi> was wild at this misfortune; and that having done ſo great ſervice to the <hi>Romans,</hi> they had not onely barred him from his betroathed Wife, but put him to lead his whole life with a woman that hated him; the greateſt vexation which the ſoule of man can ſuffer. And ſo ſoon as the Empreſſe was dead, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſent away his Wife. <hi>Germanus</hi> alſo, the Emperours brothers ſonne, had a Brother named <hi>Boraides;</hi> Who was lately dead, leaving his main eſtate to <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and his ſons, and to his own only daughter, ſo much only as law compelled. This daughter the Emperour protected, which troubled <hi>Germanus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was alſo in <hi>Conſtantinople Arſaces,</hi> an <hi>Armenian</hi> of the race of the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacides,</hi> and kindred of <hi>Artabanes.</hi> This man was taken lately in a manifeſt practiſe of Treaſon with <hi>Choſroes,</hi> King of <hi>Perſia.</hi> The Emperour puniſhed him onely with ſome few laſhes upon his back, and made him ride through the City upon a Camel: taking nothing from him, nor ſo much as baniſhing him the Court. Yet was he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:50471:128"/>for what befell him, and he deviſed miſchief againſt the Emperour and the State; finding likewiſe his Cozen <hi>Artabanes</hi> diſcontented, he provoked him more, ſurprizing him with cunning words, and chiding him. <q>That he was grown a coward and effeminate in an unfit time. He was valiant to reſcue others, and to pull down Tyrants, and had killed without any provocation <hi>Gentharis</hi> his freind, and feaſter. But that now he lay ſtill poorly and heartleſſe; while his country lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed under a perpetuall Garriſon, and unuſuall taxations, having loſt his Father treacherouſly ſlain under colour of a Treaty, and having his kinſmen made ſlaves, and ſcattered through the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. Yet <hi>Artabanes</hi> (quoth he) thinks it enough to have a <hi>Roman</hi> Generallſhip, and the bare title of a <hi>Conſull,</hi> and me your kinſman you can behold ſuffering baſe things, without condoling with me; but I pitty noble Sir your own ſufferings in both your wives, both her you have loſt, and her you muſt live with. And ſurely there is no cauſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon deliberation nor fear, that can diſcourage a man from killing <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> who ſits, at midnight without his Guards, diſcourſing with ſome old Preiſts, and buſie in endleſſe ſcanning the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Oracles. None of his kinſmen will op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you <hi>Germanus</hi> the moſt powerfull, and his Sons, young men inraged againſt <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> (I verily think) will joyn with you; that ſo the buſineſſe will even do it ſelf.</q> For they have been more wronged by him then we, or any <hi>Armenian. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaces</hi> with ſuch inchantments as theſe, finding <hi>Artabanes</hi> yeilding, imparted the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to one <hi>Chanaranges;</hi> a <hi>Perſarmenian,</hi> a handſome youth, but nothing ſerious; and having brought him and <hi>Artabanes</hi> together in the ſame reſolution, he left them, promiſing to draw <hi>Germanus</hi> and his Sons into the plot.</p>

Being met, <hi>Arſaces</hi> prayed him to aſſure him by oath, that he would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal their conference to any but to his Father. When he had ſworn accordingly, he fell to chide him. <q>That being the Emperours neereſt kinſman, and ſeeing Pettifog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and common fellowes holding all the great offices, himſelf at theſe years would endure ſo long the affaires to be managed by mean men. That the Emperour did not only deſpiſe him, but even his Father, a man attained to the height of virtue; and ſuffred <hi>Juſtinian</hi> his Brother ſtil a privat man. That he could not get the eſtate of <hi>Boraides</hi> his Uncle, who had made him his heir by his will; but was deprived of the moſt part of it: and he would deſpiſe them more, ſo ſoon as <hi>Beliſarius</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned out of <hi>Italy,</hi> who was reported to be in the midſt of <hi>Illirium.</hi> With ſuch allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he incited <hi>Juſtinus,</hi> and diſcovered the conſpiracy between him, <hi>Artabanes</hi> and <hi>Chanaranges.</hi> The young man was amazed and troubled to hear him, and plainly told him, that neither himſelf nor his Father could ever joyn in ſuch an Action. <hi>Arſaces</hi> reported the ſucceſſe to <hi>Artabanes,</hi> and <hi>Juſtinus</hi> acquainted his Father with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, who communicated it to <hi>Marcellus,</hi> Captain of the Palatine Guards, and demanded his opinion if he ſhould reveal it to the Emperour: <hi>Marcellus</hi> was a grave, auſtere man, of few words, an Enemy to jeſtings, and looſe faſhions, of a rigid life, and a ſtranger to all pleaſures; but preciſely juſt, and a zealous Lover of Truth. He would not have the matter revealed to the Emperour as yet. You (quoth he) to be the Informer, is not convenient. Upon your leaſt private conference with the Emperour, <hi>Artabanes</hi> will ſuſpect his plot to be diſcovered, and then <hi>Arſaces</hi> run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away, you will remain without proofe. And my ſelf never uſe to beleive any thing before punctually examining it, nor to report it to the Emperour.</q> I would gladly hear the diſcourſe my ſelf, or that ſome of mine might hear the men ſpeaking clearly in this ſubject. This adviſe <hi>Germanus</hi> bade his Son <hi>Juſtinus</hi> to put in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution: Who having ſo flatly denyed <hi>Arſaces,</hi> would not ſpeak of it to him again; But he askt <hi>Chanaranges,</hi> if by the privity of <hi>Artabanes, Arſaces</hi> lately came to him. I durſt not, quoth he, to ſuch a man, open my ſelf; but if you have any thing to ſay
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:50471:128"/>in it, we will adviſe, and happily may do ſomething. <hi>Chanaranges</hi> after conferring with <hi>Artabanes,</hi> told <hi>Juſtinus</hi> as much as <hi>Arſaces</hi> had done, and <hi>Juſtinus</hi> promiſed all he deſired, and to draw in his Father. And a day was appointed for <hi>Germanus</hi> to conferr with <hi>Chanaranges,</hi> and <hi>Germanus</hi> entreated <hi>Marcellus</hi> for ſome confident of his to be an ear witneſſe of <hi>Chanaranges.</hi> He ſent <hi>Leontius</hi> who married the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> a right honeſt man, who would be ſure to report the truth. Him <hi>Germanus</hi> placed in his dining roome behind the hangings, and himſelf with his Son <hi>Juſtinus</hi> ſtaid in the roome, where <hi>Leontius</hi> heard <hi>Chanaranges</hi> plainly declaring the conſpiracy between himſelf, <hi>Artabanes,</hi> and <hi>Arſaces.</hi> Then they fell to diſcourſe, that if they ſhould kill the Emperour while <hi>Beliſarius</hi> was upon his way, their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign would not ſucceed; for if they ſhould make <hi>Germanus</hi> Emperour; it was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that <hi>Beliſarius</hi> would come againſt them with an army, which he might levy in <hi>Thrace,</hi> and they ſhould not be able to keep him off. It were better to defer the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on till the coming of <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> who being in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in his Palace, they might enter at evening ſuddenly with their daggers, and kill <hi>Marcellus</hi> and <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> together with the Emperour, and ſo manage their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe as they pleaſed. <hi>Marcellus</hi> being hereof advertized by <hi>Leontius,</hi> yet forbare to report it to the Emperour, leaſt with too much haſte he might unadviſedly ruin <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabanes.</hi> But <hi>Germanus</hi> revealed it to <hi>Buzes</hi> and <hi>Conſtantianus,</hi> fearing, that which hapned, to be ſuſpected for his delay. But <hi>Beliſarius</hi> afterward being reported to be neer at hand, <hi>Marcellus</hi> revealed the Treaſon to the Emperour; who cauſed <hi>Artaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> and his Complices to be committed to the common Priſon, and to be examined by ſome principall Officers. The conſpiracy being manifeſt, and reduced into wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, the Emperour ſummoned the Senate to the place within the Palace appointed for hearing cauſes. They, albeit they heard the plain confeſſions of the Priſoners, yet had involved <hi>Germanus,</hi> and <hi>Juſtinus</hi> in the crime; if the Teſtimonies of <hi>Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> and <hi>Leontius</hi> had not cleered them: who depoſed, and <hi>Buzes</hi> alſo and <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianus,</hi> that <hi>Germanus</hi> had hid nothing from them, but demeaned himſelf, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid. So that the Senat aquitted him and his Son, as having in nothing offended the State: But coming to the Emperours chamber, the Emperour ſtormed, and was much inflamed againſt <hi>Germanus,</hi> for his ſlowneſſe in the diſcovery; and two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Officers ſeconded his opinion to pleaſe him, and they ſeemed much offended with <hi>Germanus,</hi> and to kindle more the Emperours anger, being officious to ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate themſelves by other mens miſeries. The reſt ſtood amazed without a word ſpeaking; yeilding, by not oppoſing. <hi>Marcellus</hi> only ſaved him by ſpeaking truth, taking the blame upon himſelf, and urging vehemently, that <hi>Germanus</hi> diſcovered it to him timely, but himſelf ſearching more narrowly into it, revealed it with the lateſt. And thus he pacified the Emperour, and got a great fame for uſing his virtue in a time of ſo great need. <hi>Artabanes</hi> the Emperour removed from his office, and did him no other harm, nor any of the reſt; they were reſtrained, but not diſhono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably, nor in the common priſon, but in the Palace.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Barbarians</hi> at this time were cleerly maſters of all the Weſt, and this <hi>Gothick</hi> war was now come to this, that the <hi>Romans</hi> who at firſt won all afore them, had now conſumed their men and money to no purpoſe, had loſt <hi>Italy,</hi> and ſtood looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon <hi>Illyrium</hi> and <hi>Thrace,</hi> ſhamefully waſted by <hi>Barbarians</hi> their next borderers. In the beginning of this war, the <hi>Goths</hi> gave to the <hi>Francks</hi> all <hi>Gallia,</hi> ſubject to them, being not able to fight with both, as I have ſaid. This the <hi>Romans</hi> hindred not, but <hi>Juſtinian</hi> confirmed the Gift, that he might not be croſt by a war from theſe <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians;</hi> nor would the <hi>Francks</hi> have thought their poſſeſſion ſure, if the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour had not put his Seal to the Act. Hereupon the Kings of the <hi>Francks</hi> got <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles,</hi> a colony of the <hi>Phocaeans,</hi> and all the Sea townes, and were Maſters of that Sea: And now they ſit in <hi>Arles,</hi> beholding the horſe races there, they coyn Gold Staters out of the Gold mines in <hi>Gaule,</hi> not with the ſtamp of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour (as the cuſtome is) but with their own Images. The King of <hi>Perſia</hi> coynes ſilver monies as he pleaſes, but it is not lawfull for him, nor any King of <hi>Barbarians</hi> to put his own ſtamp upon a Gold Stater, though he be a greater Maſter of Gold; for ſuch money they cannot put away, though they trade with <hi>Barbarian</hi> Merchants. But the <hi>Francks</hi> ſeeing <hi>Totilas</hi> prevaile, ſeized the moſt part of <hi>Venetia;</hi> the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> had no power to reſiſt, nor the <hi>Goths</hi> to make war upon both.</p>

               <p>THE <hi>Gepaedes</hi> alſo took <hi>Syrmium,</hi> and almoſt all <hi>Dacia,</hi> ſo ſoon as <hi>Juſtinian</hi> had taken them from the <hi>Goths;</hi> making the <hi>Romans</hi> their Captives, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill onward ſpoyling the <hi>Roman</hi> Provinces; ſo that the Emperour paid them no more the Penſions they anciently received of the <hi>Romans.</hi> To the <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards</hi> alſo he gave the City of <hi>Noricum,</hi> and the ſtrong places in <hi>Pannonia,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Townes, and great ſums of Money, who thereupon left their own Country, and planted by the River <hi>Iſter</hi> neer unto the <hi>Gepaedes:</hi> and pillaged likewiſe <hi>Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matia,</hi> and <hi>Illyrium,</hi> to <hi>Epidamnus;</hi> leading the People Captive: of whom if any chanced to run away, and get home, theſe <hi>Lombards</hi> being in league with us, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ranging in the <hi>Roman</hi> Provinces, and diſcovering any of theſe Fugitives, laid hold of them as their Slaves, and haling them from their Parents, led them back with them without any oppoſition. The <hi>Herulians</hi> alſo had given them by the Emperour places in <hi>Dacia,</hi> neer the City of <hi>Singidon</hi> where now they inhabit, and from thence over-run and ſpoile <hi>Illyrium</hi> and <hi>Thrace:</hi> Some of them turned <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Souldiers, and were rancked with the Confederates. And theſe <hi>Herulian</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours, when they come to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> receive their full Penſions, without much attendance, notwithſtanding they ranſack dayly the <hi>Roman</hi> Subjects. And thus all theſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> ſhared among them the ſpoile of the Empire.</p>
               <p>Not long after the <hi>Gepaedes,</hi> and <hi>Lombards,</hi> being Neighbours, became Enemies, and a day was appointed for a pitch-field between them. The <hi>Lombards</hi> inferiour in numbers, and holding themſelves to be over-matcht, reſolved to invite the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> to aide them in the Battell; the <hi>Gepaedes</hi> alſo having truce with us, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous the <hi>Romans</hi> would joyne with them, or ſtand neutrall: And both of them ſent Ambaſſadours to <hi>Juſtinian</hi> for aide. <hi>Thoriſin</hi> was then Prince of the <hi>Gepaedes,</hi> and <hi>Audouin</hi> of the <hi>Lombards.</hi> The Emperour heard their Propoſitions, not toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but ſeverally. The <hi>Lombards</hi> having firſt acceſſe, ſpake thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Great Emperour, we are amazed at the impertinency of theſe <hi>Gepaedes;</hi> who having acted ſo many great wrongs upon your Dominions, come here to offer the fouleſt ſcorne that can be, in thinking you eaſie to be deceived, and ſo coming to make uſe of your ſimplicity. But we deſire you Sir, to conſider their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in this friendſhip; ſo will you deale the more ſecurely for your Empire, and judge more ſafely of the Future by what is paſt. If their ingratitude had been ſhewn only to other Nations, you might expect from us long diſcourſes, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne teſtimonies to convince them thereof. But you have the experiment now even in your own ſelves. The <hi>Goths</hi> formerly held all <hi>Dacia</hi> tributary, whom the <hi>Gepaedes</hi> dwelling on the further ſide of the <hi>Iſter</hi> ſo feared, that they never durſt attempt to paſſe over the River. But being in truce with the <hi>Romans,</hi> and their great Friends, and in that Title receiving large yearly Penſions, as well from former Emperours, as your ſelfe; what Services have they done you for the ſame? They can alledge not one. When they knew not how to wrong you, their diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, not good intent, kept them quiet. Beyond the <hi>Iſter</hi> you would not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and from this ſide the feare of the <hi>Goths</hi> reſtrained them. And can diſability be called gratitude, or good nature? Can a firm Friend be known, while he wants power to tranſgreſſe? No Sir, It is a mans power only that expreſſes his nature and intentions, good or bad; his ability to do what he liſt, laying his diſpoſition to the publick view. For theſe <hi>Gepaedes</hi> no ſooner ſaw the <hi>Goths</hi> gone out of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> and you buſie with your Enemies, but the wicked wretches intruded every where upon your territories. Their baſeneſſe herein what words can expreſſe? Have they not deſpiſed the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire? broken the ſacred Lawes of Truces, put ſcornes upon their Benefactors, and violated that Empire, whoſe Slaves they would be proud to be, if you had any leiſure for them. They hold <hi>Syrmium,</hi> and vaunt all <hi>Dacia</hi> to be theirs; in what War having been ever victorious, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for you, with you, or againſt you? or of what Battell having made that Province the prize? Nay, being ancient Mercenaries, and receiving your Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, as hath been ſaid. Then, a more lewd proceeding then this Ambaſſage of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:50471:129"/>theirs was never. Now when they ſee us quarrelling with them, they have the face to come to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and to the Emperours preſence, whom they have ſo much abuſed; and peradventure in their aboundant impudence will intreat your aide againſt us, who have ſhewed our ſelves ſo affectionate to you. If they come to reſtore what they have unjuſtly intruded into, you muſt impute it to the <hi>Lombards,</hi> the chiefe Cauſers of their repentance; a conſtrained feare of whom, hath put on them this form of gratitude: And if you receive the benefit, you muſt thank thoſe who made the doing it neceſſary. But if now neither they will part with what belongs not to them, what an exceſſe of ill nature is this? Let this ſuffice, O Emperour, to be ſpoken in a <hi>Barbarian</hi> ſimplicity, with words not reaching the matter. And do you, Sir, weigh well, what hath been uttered more ſcantly then the occaſion requires; and do that which may be beſt for the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and your own <hi>Lombards;</hi> conſidering alſo, that you ſhall do well to joyne with us, who are of the ſame Orthodoxall Religion; and to oppoſe theſe, being <hi>Arians.</hi> The <hi>Lombards</hi> ſo ſpake, and the next day the <hi>Gepaedes</hi> Ambaſſadours were brought to the Emperour, and ſaid in this manner. It is right and fit, O Emperour, for men demanding aides, firſt to ſhew, that they ask things reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and juſt, and good for thoſe who are to aide them, and ſo to ſpeak what concernes their Ambaſſage. It is plain therefore, that we are wronged by the <hi>Lombards,</hi> in that we have endeavoured to end our differences in a courſe of juſtice; and we ſtriving to have a legall way, cannot be ſaid to uſe violence. And that the <hi>Gepaedes</hi> exceed the <hi>Lombards</hi> in multitude and goodneſſe of men, what need many words to them that know it? And we think no wiſe man will run into evident danger, by ſiding with the weaker, when he may get a Victory by joyning with the ſtronger. The <hi>Gepaedes</hi> moreover will aſſiſt you againſt your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, upon obligation of gratitude for what you now ſhall do for them, and with the greatneſſe of their power are likely to make you Maſters of your Foes. Conſider alſo, that the <hi>Lombards</hi> are but lately in amity with you; but the <hi>Gepae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> are of your ancient acquaintance and allyance; and Friend-ſhip grown with time is not eaſily diſſolved. It is good for you therefore to make us your Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates, being both powerfull, and firm to you. Theſe juſt reaſons may draw you to this Confederacy; but ſee the diſpoſitions of theſe <hi>Lombards.</hi> Being intreated to end the quarrell legally, by no meanes they will conſent, out of a groundleſſe over-weening. But the War being ready for a Battell, now they ſhrink, being conſcious of their own weakneſſe, and fly to you, importuning you without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to fight for them. And theſe Theeves alledge, to provoke you to a War, our holding <hi>Syrmium,</hi> and ſome other places in <hi>Dacia:</hi> Whereas in your Empire are ſo many Cities and Countries, that you ſeek for men upon whom to beſtow ſome of them to dwell in. To the <hi>Francks,</hi> to the <hi>Herulians,</hi> and theſe <hi>Lombards</hi> you have given ſo many Townes and proportions of Land, that they cannot be numbred. And we being bold in your Friend-ſhip and Favour, have done what your ſelfe would have to be done. And whoſoever hath a mind to part with a thing, eſteemes him the worthier man, who from a free Spirit is aforehand, and of himſelfe takes the benefit, them him that gets it as a courteſie; if the Giver ſet the valuation of the thing ſo, as not to inſult upon the Receiver; but as being bold upon him, as of an aſſured Friend: Which is the caſe of the <hi>Gepaedes</hi> with the <hi>Romans.</hi> And which you taking into conſideration, we deſire you in the firſt place to joyn your powers to ours againſt the <hi>Lombards,</hi> according to the Leagues with us; and if not, to ſtand neutrall. By thus adviſing you ſhall do juſtly, and expediently for the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.</q>

               <p>BUT <hi>Juſtinian</hi> after a long conſultation herein, diſmiſt the <hi>Gepaedes</hi> with a refuſall, and ſwore a League with the <hi>Lombards;</hi> And he ſent them 10000. Horſe under <hi>Conſtantianus, Buzes</hi> and <hi>Aratius,</hi> aſſiſted by <hi>John</hi> lately come out of <hi>Italy,</hi> who by the Emperours direction was to return into <hi>Italy</hi> with his Troops, ſo ſoon as the Battell with the <hi>Gepaedes</hi> was fought. There were alſo with them 1500. <hi>Herulians,</hi> commanded by <hi>Philimuth</hi> and others. The reſt of the <hi>Herulian</hi> Forces being 3000. and lately revolted from the <hi>Romans</hi> (as I have ſaid formerly) were on the part of the <hi>Gepaedes.</hi> Some of theſe led by <hi>Aordus</hi> their Princes Brother, a party of the <hi>Romans</hi> marching to the aide of the <hi>Lombards</hi> met, routed them, and killed <hi>Aordus,</hi> and many more. But the <hi>Gepaedes</hi> underſtanding the <hi>Roman</hi> Army to be neer, compounded the quarrell with the <hi>Lombards,</hi> and a Truce was concluded without the <hi>Romans;</hi> who being thereof advertiſed, were troubled, being not able to go on, nor to return back: and they feared leaſt the <hi>Gepaedes</hi> and <hi>Herulians</hi> ſhould make a joynt in-road into <hi>Illyrium,</hi> and ſpoile it. So they lay ſtill, and advertiſed the Emperour. Thus much by way of digreſſion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe ocurrents.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Beliſarius</hi> was now returning to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> with no honour. In five yeares ſpace he never marcht up into the land of <hi>Italy,</hi> made no expedition, but was all the while in a perpetuall flight, ſailing from one ſtrong Sea-Town to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which gave the Enemy meanes to captivate <hi>Rome,</hi> and all the reſt. He abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Peruſia,</hi> the chiefe City of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> which was taken by aſſault while he was in his way home. Being come to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and now grown extream rich, and much reſpected for his former Victories, he made his continuall aboad there. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Voyage into <hi>Africa,</hi> God gave him a cleer preſage of his good Fortunes. He had Land in <hi>Panteichion,</hi> the Suburb of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> right over againſt the City; where immediately before his expedition againſt <hi>Gelimer,</hi> and <hi>Africk,</hi> his Vines were very full taken, and many Veſſels were ſilled with the Wine thereof, which had their bottomes buried in the ground, and their tops faſt cloſed with Clay in the Wine-Cellar. Eight months after the Wine workt out of the Veſſels, forcing out the Clay, and made the Cellar a puddle. The Servants wondred at it, filled many Flaggons with it, and ſtopped up the Veſſels again, and concealed the Accident. But the ſame happening often, they acquainted their Maſter with it; and he ſhewed it to divers of his Friends, who divined from thence much happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to be coming to his Houſe. This thus happened to <hi>Beliſarius.</hi> But now <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Italians</hi> at Court being many, and of good quality, beſought the Emperour to vindicate <hi>Italy</hi> with all his power. Above all <hi>Gothigus</hi> preſſed him, being a <hi>Patrician,</hi> and late <hi>Conſull,</hi> and newly arrived at <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> for this purpoſe. The Emperour promiſed to take care of <hi>Italy,</hi> but he ſpent the moſt of his time about the Chriſtians Controverſies, endeavouring to ſettle the ſame.</p>
               <p>During this War <hi>Ildiges,</hi> a <hi>Lombard,</hi> came with forces as far as to <hi>Venetia,</hi> upon this occaſion. <hi>Vaces,</hi> late Prince of the <hi>Lombards,</hi> had <hi>Riſiulphus</hi> his Brothers Son, who by the Law was to ſucceed him; but <hi>Vaces</hi> plotting the Succeſſion for his own Son, charged <hi>Riſiulphus</hi> with ſome groundleſſe Crime, and baniſhed him. <hi>Riſiulphus</hi> fled to the <hi>Varnians,</hi> leaving two Sons behind him: Theſe <hi>Barbarians Vaces</hi> hired to kill <hi>Riſiulpus;</hi> and one of his two Sons dyed: but <hi>Ildeges,</hi> the other, fled to the <hi>Slavonians.</hi> Not long after <hi>Vaces</hi> dyed, and the Government came to <hi>Valdarus,</hi> his Son; who being a Child, <hi>Audovin</hi> was made his Protector, and attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby to great power, he got the abſolute Government to himſelfe: And ſhortly after the Child dyed. When the <hi>Lombards</hi> and <hi>Gepaedes</hi> were in War, <hi>Ildi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> brought to the <hi>Gepaedes</hi> ſuch <hi>Lombards</hi> as followed him; and many <hi>Slavoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> hoping that the <hi>Gepaedes</hi> would reſtore him to the Government. But when the Truce was made, <hi>Audouin</hi> demanded <hi>Ildiges</hi> of the <hi>Gepaedes,</hi> now his Friends. They would not betray him, but they bad him be gone, and ſave himſelfe. He with his own followers and ſome few <hi>Gepaedes</hi> went again to the <hi>Slavonians,</hi> and from thence marcht towards <hi>Totilas</hi> with about 6000. men; And in <hi>Venetia</hi> meeting
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:50471:130"/>
                  <hi>Romans</hi> led by <hi>Lazarus,</hi> he killed many of them; yet would not joyn with the <hi>Goths,</hi> but paſſed the <hi>Iſter</hi> again, and retired to the <hi>Slavonians.</hi> About the ſame time alſo <hi>Ilauf,</hi> one of the Life-guard to <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> and Valiant, being left in <hi>Italy,</hi> revolted to <hi>Totilas,</hi> who ſent him immediately with a Navie, and Forces into <hi>Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matia.</hi> He at <hi>Monecurus,</hi> a Town upon the Sea neer <hi>Salonae,</hi> at firſt was familiar with the Towneſ-men, as a <hi>Roman,</hi> and appertaining to <hi>Beliſarius:</hi> But ſuddenly he put them all to the Sword, and ſackt the Town. The like he did at <hi>Laureata,</hi> a Caſtle upon the Sea Coaſt. <hi>Claudianus,</hi> Governour of <hi>Salonae,</hi> ſent Forces againſt him in <hi>Pinnaces;</hi> who at <hi>Laureata</hi> fought with the Enemy, and had the worſe, ran away, and left their Pinnaces in the Haven; which <hi>Ilauf</hi> took, together with other Ships laden with Corn and Proviſions; and having killed and ſpoiled all they found, he returned to <hi>Totilas:</hi> When the Winter ended, and the 14. yeare of this War, written by <hi>Procopius.</hi>

At the day <hi>Totilas</hi> launched into the <hi>Tiber,</hi> about the firſt watch of the night, two ſmall Veſſells with Trumpet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters aboard; whom he directed, having rowed up neer the City walls, to ſound their Trumpets.

               <p>THEY in the ſmall Veſſells being come neer to <hi>Rome,</hi> ſounded their Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, as they were directed: wherewith the <hi>Romans</hi> amazed, ſuddenly in feare and tumult left each man his Guard, and ran to ſuccour there, where they ſuſpected the Enemy would aſſault. Onely the <hi>Iſaurian</hi> Traytors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued upon their Guard, opened the Gate, and received in the Enemy. Much ſlaughter there was; &amp; many ran out at other Gates, and in their way to <hi>Centum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellae</hi> fell upon the Enemies ambuſhes, and were cut in peices. Some few hardly eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped; and <hi>Diogenes</hi> himſelfe, after receiving a hurt. <hi>Paulus</hi> a <hi>Cilician,</hi> who had at firſt commanded <hi>Beliſarius</hi> his Retinue, and now commanded a Party of Horſe, had the guarding of <hi>Rome</hi> committed to him with <hi>Diogenes;</hi> and the City being taken, ran with four hundred Horſe to <hi>Adrians</hi> Tombe, and poſſeſt the Bridge leading to Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Church.

The next day they thought of feeding on their Horſes, but being loath to meddle with ſuch uncouth food (though much pincht with hunger) late in the evening they fell to debate it, and exhorted one another valiantly rather to
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:50471:131"/>end their lives by an honourable death; charging the Enemy ſuddenly, and killing as many as they could: So they imbraced and kiſſed one another, as being inſtantly all to periſh. <hi>Totilas</hi> was affraid of men reſolute to dye, leaſt diſpairing of their owne ſafety, they might do ſome deſperate miſcheife; and he ſent to them, of two Propoſitions to chuſe, either to quit their Horſes and Armes, and to ſweare never more to ſerve againſt the <hi>Goths,</hi> and ſo to returne to <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> or keeping what they had, to ſerve with the <hi>Goths</hi> in equall condition. The <hi>Romans</hi> glad of the Propoſition, at firſt choſe to go to <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> but afterward, as aſhamed to march away on foot, and unarmed, and fearing to be cut off by ambuſhes in their way, murmuring alſo for their many yeares arreares owing to them by the <hi>Roman</hi> Treaſury, they joyned with the <hi>Goths</hi> Army. <hi>Paul</hi> onely, and one <hi>Mindes,</hi> an <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaurian,</hi> beſought <hi>Totilas</hi> to ſend them to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> having Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in their Countreys, without whom they could not live. Whom <hi>Totilas</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for dealing plainely, and gave them proviſion for their journey, and a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy. The reſt of the Army being in Churches about three hundred, took aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances and yeilded to <hi>Totilas.</hi> Who would not now demoliſh any more of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor quit it, but intended to plant there <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> together, both Senators and others, upon this occaſion. He had lately demanded of the King of the <hi>Francks</hi> his Daughter in marriage; who rejected the motion, ſaying, That he neither was, nor ever would be King of <hi>Italy,</hi> having taken <hi>Rome,</hi> but not able to keep it, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving demoliſhed part, and quitted the reſt to his Enemies. So that now he brought in Proviſions, and commanded to re-edifie what was beaten downe at his firſt taking of <hi>Rome.</hi> And he ſent for the Roman Senators, and other Romans confined in <hi>Campania;</hi> held the ſolemnity of the <hi>Circenſian</hi> Games, and then prepared for a Voyage into <hi>Sicily:</hi> He put in readineſſe four hundred ſmall Veſſels for a Sea-fight, and many great Ships ſent out of the Eaſt by the Emperour, and taken by him with their men and ladings. He ſent alſo <hi>Stephanus</hi> a Roman his Ambaſſador to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, deſiring Truce, upon condition, that the <hi>Goths</hi> ſhould ſerve him againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Nation. But <hi>Juſtinian</hi> ſuffered not the Ambaſſadour to come into his preſence, nor regarded the Propoſition: Which <hi>Totilas</hi> underſtanding, prepared firſt to attempt <hi>Centumcellae,</hi> and then to go into <hi>Sicily. Diogenes</hi> commanded the Garriſon there, being reaſonably ſtrong. The <hi>Goths</hi> beſieged it, and <hi>Totilas</hi> ſent to <hi>Diogenes,</hi> either to put it to a Battell inſtantly, there being no hope of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours from the Emperour; of whoſe diſability to continue War with the <hi>Goths,</hi> the ſucceſſe at <hi>Rome,</hi> after ſo long ſpace given, was a ſufficient Argument; or elſe to chuſe either to joyn with the <hi>Goths</hi> Army upon equall tearmes, or to quit <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumcellae,</hi> and to go ſafe to <hi>Conſtantinople. Diogenes</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> refuſed the Battell, neither would mingle with the <hi>Goths</hi> Army, nor live without their Wives and Children; And chuſing to be ſent to the Emperour, they ſaid, they had yet no honeſt excuſe to ſurrender the Town; and therefore deſired time to ſignifie their Eſtate to the Emperour, that receiving no ſuccour from him, they might ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Town, and be gone, not without ſome pretence. <hi>Totilas</hi> approving this, a day was aſſigned, and 30. Hoſtages were given on both ſides; and the <hi>Goths</hi> raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Siege and went for <hi>Sicily.</hi> Before they paſſed the ſtraits there, they attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Rhegium,</hi> where the Garriſon was commanded by <hi>Thurimuth</hi> and <hi>Himerius,</hi> left by <hi>Beliſarius;</hi> who having many good men within, kept off the Enemy aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulting, and ſallying had the better; but being inferiour in numbers, they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward lay ſtill. <hi>Totilas</hi> blockt up the Town with part of his Army, hoping in time to take it for want of Victuall. He ſent alſo Forces, who took the Caſtle of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentum:</hi> And at the ſame time the <hi>Goths</hi> in <hi>Picenia</hi> had <hi>Ariminum</hi> betrayed to them. <hi>Juſtinias</hi> hereof advertiſed, made <hi>Germanus</hi> his Brothers Son, abſolute Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall in the Warre againſt the <hi>Goths,</hi> commanding him to be in readineſſe. The <hi>Goths</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> were much troubled at the report of it, (<hi>Germanus</hi> being very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in the World.) And the <hi>Romans,</hi> eſpecially the Army, getting hart and hope, held out more firmly againſt their toiles and dangers. But the Emperour (I know not why) changed his mind, and appointed <hi>Liberius</hi> a Citizen of <hi>Rome</hi> for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; who made himſelfe ready, add was expected inſtantly to ſaile away with the Army. But the Emperour changed again, ſo that he too ſtaid at home. Then alſo <hi>Verus</hi> having gotten together many of the valianteſt Souldiers, had a Battell with
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:50471:131"/>the <hi>Goths</hi> in <hi>Picenia,</hi> not far from <hi>Ravenna;</hi> wherein after the loſſe of many, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing valiantly, himſelf was ſlaine.</p>

               <p>ABOUT this time a party of ſome three thouſand <hi>Slavonians</hi> came over the River <hi>Iſter,</hi> none oppoſing them, and paſt the river of <hi>Eurus:</hi> then they ſevered eighteen hundred in one party, and the reſt in another. The <hi>Roman</hi> commanders in <hi>Illyrium,</hi> and <hi>Thrace</hi> fought with them ſeverally, and were beaten, with loſſe of ſome men, the reſt ſhamefully running away, though the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians</hi> were far the fewer. They incountred alſo <hi>Asbades,</hi> who had been of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Life-Guard, and advanced to the place of a <hi>Candidate,</hi> and who comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded now troops of horſe anciently Garriſon'd in <hi>Tzurulum,</hi> a Caſtle of <hi>Thrace,</hi> good men. Him the <hi>Slavonians</hi> defeated, and killed moſt of his men ſhamefully running away: They took him priſoner, and ſoon after cut thongs from the skin of his back, and threw him into a flame of fire: Then without controule they pilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged all <hi>Thrace,</hi> and <hi>Illyrium,</hi> and took many caſtles, having never before aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a wall, nor preſumed to come to an open feild. They never durſt before this time forrage the Roman Territory, nor ever paſt the <hi>Iſter</hi> before. But after their victory againſt <hi>Asbades,</hi> they pillaged all to the Sea, and took <hi>Topirum,</hi> the firſt Sea Town of <hi>Thrace,</hi> by aſſault, having a Garriſon in it, being diſtant twelve dayes journey from <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> They took it thus. The moſt of them hid themſelves in the faſtneſſes neer the Town; and ſome few alarm'd the <hi>Romans</hi> upon the battlements; who thinking them no more then they ſaw, ſallied: The <hi>Barbarians</hi> ſeemed afraid, and ran away; and the <hi>Romans</hi> being far from the Walls, the Ambuſhes roſe, and put themſelves between them and the Town: and the flyers turning head, the <hi>Romans</hi> were charged on all ſides, and all cut in peices.</p>
               <p>The inhabitants deprived of the Souldiers, yet reſiſted the Enemies aſſault, as they could, powring down boyling oyl and pitch, and throwing down great ſtones, that they had almoſt beat off the danger: But the <hi>Barbarians</hi> with a multitude of arrowes forced them from the battlements, and with their ſcaling ladders took the City by aſſault. They killed fifteen thouſand men in it, and ſackt it. The women and children they made ſlaves, having formerly ſpared no age nor ſex but killing ſtill all they met from the time they entred Roman Land. So that all <hi>Thrace</hi> and <hi>Illyrium</hi> was ſcattered with dead bodies unburied; they killed not the people with Swords nor Lances, nor in any uſuall manner; but they pitcht ſtakes into the Ground with ſharp ends upward, and ſet the poor wretches upon the ſame at their fundaments; then forced them downwards, and the ſtakes up into their Entrailes. They ſtuck in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ground alſo four poſts, to which they tied their priſoners hands and feet then knockt their heads with clubs, and killed them like ſo many Dogs, or Snakes. Others they ſhut up in houſes with ſuch cattell as they could not drive home into their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and without mercy burned them together. In the end, being drunck with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of bloud, both the parties of theſe <hi>Slavonians</hi> were pleaſed to make priſoners of thoſe they met, and ſo returned home with innumerable captives.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the <hi>Goths</hi> aſſaulting <hi>Rhegium,</hi> were bravely beaten off by the Garriſon, <hi>Thurimuth</hi> doing very valiantly. <hi>Totilas</hi> underſtanding that their victuall grew ſcarce, left part of his army to block it from proviſions, and ſo to compell the Garriſon to yeild in time; and himſelfe croſt the ſtraits into <hi>Sicily,</hi> and ſet upon <hi>Meſſina. Domentiolus</hi> the commander, ſiſters Son to <hi>Buzes,</hi> ſallied, and had not the worſe in fight; but afterward kept themſelves quiet within the walls, and the <hi>Goths</hi> plundred all <hi>Sicily,</hi> none reſiſting them. In the mean time <hi>Thurimuth</hi> and <hi>Himerius</hi> in <hi>Rhegium,</hi> (when their victuall was all gone) yeilded themſelves and the Caſtle by compoſition to the Enemy. The Emperour, at the newes of theſe ſucceſſes, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd a fleet, &amp; put an army aboard of foot, under <hi>Liberius,</hi> whom he required to ſail with ſpeed for <hi>Sicily,</hi> and to ſave the Iſland. But <hi>Liberius</hi> being an extream old man, and no ſouldier, the Emperour repented, and ſent <hi>Artabanes</hi> for <hi>Sicily,</hi> remitting his crimes, and making him Generall of <hi>Thrace.</hi> He gave him no great forces, but

                  <hi>Germanus</hi> was ambitious to get the honour of vanquiſhing, the <hi>Goths</hi> and the good fortune to recover both <hi>Affrick</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> to the Empire. In <hi>Africa</hi> where <hi>Stotzas</hi> had uſurped, he overcame him and the mutiners unexpectedly, and reduced the Province as it is in my former relations. And <hi>Italy</hi> being now redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the Eſtate I have deſcribed, he deſired the Glory of recovering that alſo. His wife <hi>Paſſara</hi> being long ſince deceaſed, he married <hi>Mattaſuntha,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Amalaſuntha,</hi> the daughter of <hi>Theoderick,</hi> her former husband <hi>Vitigis</hi> being late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dead. He hoped that the <hi>Goths</hi> would be aſhamed to lift their armes againſt this Lady, remembring the Reignes of <hi>Theoderick</hi> and <hi>Atalarick.</hi> Moreover freely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſing the Emperours mony, and his own more, he levied quickly, and unexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a very gallant army. The beſt <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers left their ordinary commanders (whoſe Lanciers and Targettiers they were) and followed <hi>Germanus;</hi> together with many <hi>Conſtantinopolitans, Thracians,</hi> and <hi>Illyrians;</hi> wherein <hi>Juſtinus</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinianus</hi> his Sons uſed much care and diligence. He pickt the beſt out of the horſe Troops, garriſon'd in <hi>Thrace,</hi> and many <hi>Barbarians</hi> about the <hi>Iſter</hi> were drawn by the ſame of <hi>Germanus,</hi> and brought much mony with them, and joyned with the <hi>Roman</hi> army. The Prince of the <hi>Lombards</hi> promiſed to ſend him a thouſand men well armed. Report as in all human things, made all this in <hi>Italy</hi> much more, and the <hi>Goths</hi> were afraid, and troubled withall to make war now againſt the poſterity of <hi>Theoderick:</hi> And the <hi>Roman</hi> ſouldiers there, ſent to ſignifie to <hi>Germanus,</hi> that ſo ſoon as they ſaw him in <hi>Italy,</hi> and his army intrenched, they would immediatly joine with him. The remainder alſo of the Emperours army in <hi>Ravenna,</hi> and ſome other Towns, took courage, and reſolved to guard their Towns firmly for the Emperour. Nay, thoſe who had been beaten with <hi>Verus</hi> and others, and went now ſtragling, hearing that <hi>Germanus</hi> was upon his way, they rallied themſelves in <hi>Iſtria,</hi> and ſtaid for the ſaid army. <hi>Totilas</hi> then at the day aſſigned, ſent to <hi>Diogenes</hi> to ſurrender <hi>Centumcellae,</hi> according to the capitulation. <hi>Diogenes</hi> anſwered that he had no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er now, <hi>Germanus</hi> being declared abſolute Generall, and not far off with his army; and he deſired him to ſend him his hoſtages, and he would reſtore thoſe given by the <hi>Goths,</hi> and ſo he diſmiſt the meſſenger, and carefully guarded the town, expecting <hi>Germanus</hi> and his army. And thus the winter ended, &amp; the 15 year of this war, written by <hi>Procopius.</hi>
               </p>

They ſaid it was to ſack <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> and the Towns about it. The Emperour upon this advertizement, wrote to <hi>Germanus</hi> to defer his Journy into <hi>Italy,</hi> and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> and to beat away the <hi>Slavonians;</hi> who grew afraid when they heard from their priſoners that <hi>Germanus</hi> upon this ſtaid ſtill at <hi>Sardice,</hi> whoſe fame was great among all the <hi>Barbarians</hi> upon this occaſion. During the Raign of <hi>Juſtine,</hi> his great Uncle, the <hi>Antians,</hi> who inhabite next unto the <hi>Slavonians,</hi> paſt the <hi>Iſter,</hi> and invaded the <hi>Roman</hi> territories with a great army. <hi>Germanus</hi> was lately made Generall of <hi>Thrace,</hi> and in a battell with theſe Enemies killed them almoſt all, which got him a great reputation, eſpecially among theſe people. So that fearing him now, and ſuppoſing him to have a very great army, as being ſent againſt the <hi>Goths,</hi> they forbare their intents againſt <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> and went over the mountaines of <hi>Illyrium</hi> into <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> not daring to appear in the Champian. And <hi>Germanus</hi> deſpiſing them, directed his army to be in readineſſe, within three daies, to begin the journy into <hi>Italy;</hi> but he ſuddenly fell into a ſickneſſe, which made an end of him. And ſo was <hi>Germanus</hi> quickly loſt; a vertuous man and very valiant; both an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:50471:132"/>Generall, and a daring Souldier. In peace and proſperity a conſtant obſerver of Lawes and good Government: He was a moſt upright Judge, and to men in need he lent great Sums, without ſo much as talking of any Intereſt. In the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace and in the <hi>Forum</hi> ſevere and ſtern, but at home and at his Table pleaſant, free, and gracious, where he had power: he prevented the Errours and innovations of the Emperours Court: And he never conſented nor converſed with the muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous <hi>Veneti,</hi> and <hi>Praſini, Conſtantinople,</hi> though many great men ran into that abſurdity. The Emperour was much grieved at this ſudden.

But a ſtrong gale turn'd them back into <hi>Peloponeſus,</hi> and ſome were caſt away, others eſcaped. The Ship wherein <hi>Artabanes</hi> was, loſt her main Maſt, and being abandoned to the Tide, and Waves, and in much danger, put in at the Iſland of <hi>Malta,</hi> and by this meanes he was unexpectedly preſerved.

                  <hi>John</hi> and the Emperours Army meant to winter at <hi>Salonae,</hi> and from thence with the firſt of the Spring to march by Land to <hi>Ravenna.</hi> But the <hi>Slavonians,</hi> both thoſe who formerly forraged the Empire, and others, ſpoyled again with full li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty the Provinces.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y diſcourſe hath hitherto been diſtributed and accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the ſeverall places where the actions were done, and is publiſht throughout the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. But now I cannot compile the ſame in that manner, nor inſert into a Hiſtory already publiſht ſucceeding Occurrents; but muſt write in this Tract apart, touching theſe Enemies, and the <hi>Perſians,</hi> what hath happened ſince the Edition of my Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and ſo the diſcourſe thereof cannot be but mixt. The Occurrents untill the fourth yeare of the <hi>Quinquenniall Ceſſation</hi> between the <hi>Romans</hi> and the <hi>Perſians,</hi> were formerly related. The yeare following a <hi>Perſian</hi> Army invaded <hi>Lazica,</hi> under <hi>Chorſanes</hi> a <hi>Perſian,</hi> and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Commander, accompanied with <hi>Alans.</hi> This Army encamped it ſelfe in a Province of <hi>Lazica,</hi> named <hi>Mucheiriſis,</hi> by which the River of <hi>Phaſis</hi> runns, not navigable there, but to be paſt by Men and Horſes; and they entrencht to the right hand of it ſome diſtance off.</p>
               <p>But that the Readers may have a cleer notion of <hi>Lazica,</hi> and of the people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, and not converſe with things obſcure to them, like men fighting with ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows: I have thought it ſeaſonable here to diſcourſe, what kinde of people dwell upon the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea; conceiving, that the Ancients who have written thereof, have not handled it exactly; ſpeaking of <hi>Tzanians,</hi> whom they make to border with the <hi>Trapezuntians,</hi> and name <hi>Colchians;</hi> and calling the now <hi>Lazians</hi> by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther name; being in both miſtaken. For the <hi>Tzanians</hi> are high in the Land, and border upon <hi>Armenia,</hi> having ſteep Mountaines in the way to it, a vaſt and deſart Countrey, deep Torrents, and Hills thick with Wood, and unacceſſible Valleys;
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:50471:136"/>all which are between them and the Sea. Nor can the <hi>Colchians</hi> be other then the <hi>Lazians,</hi> ſeeing they dwell now upon the <hi>Phaſis.</hi> They have onely changed their name, as many other Nations. And ſince thoſe Writers many ages have innovated much, by the tranſplantations of people, and ſucceſſions of Princes, and altered their names. All which I am to take notice of, omitting both fabulous and old ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolete things; as upon what part of the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea the Poets bound <hi>Prometheus,</hi> (Hiſtories and Fables being different workes) but to ſet downe punctually both names and things notorious in thoſe parts.</p>
               <p>This Sea begins at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and ends in <hi>Lazica.</hi> Within it on the right hand is <hi>Bithynia;</hi> then <hi>Honorias,</hi> and <hi>Paphlagonia,</hi> where ſtand <hi>Heraclea</hi> and <hi>Amaſtris,</hi> Maritime Townes. Next to them are the <hi>Pontick</hi> Nations, to the borders of <hi>Trapezond,</hi> where are <hi>Sinope</hi> and <hi>Amiſus,</hi> Sea townes; not far from <hi>Amiſus</hi> is <hi>Themiſcyrus,</hi> and the River <hi>Thermodon,</hi> where they ſay was the <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zons</hi> Campe; of whom more anon. The territory of <hi>Trapezond</hi> reaches to <hi>Suſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maena,</hi> and <hi>Rizaeum,</hi> which ſtands upon the coaſt in the way to <hi>Lazica,</hi> two dayes journey from <hi>Trapezond.</hi> In all the Territory of that City of <hi>Trapezond</hi> the Hony is bitter: To the right hand of theſe Cities are the Mountaines of <hi>Tzanica,</hi> beyond which is the <hi>Roman Armenia.</hi> From thoſe Mountaines deſcends the River of <hi>Boas,</hi> through infinite Thickets, and a Woodland Countrey, into <hi>Lazica,</hi> and diſimbogues into the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea; then it quits the name of <hi>Boas,</hi> and takes that of <hi>Acampſis,</hi> becauſe it bends not, nor yeilds to the current of the Sea. For the ſtream is ſo ſtrong and troublous, that running farr into the Sea, the Ships ſayling that way keep off at Sea, not able to hold on their courſe, and cut thorough that ſwift ſtreame.</p>
               <p>Next to <hi>Rizaeum</hi> are Mountaines dividing <hi>Lazica</hi> from <hi>Roman</hi> Land, and inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by free Nations, and a Village called <hi>Athens;</hi> not ſo called from a Colony of <hi>Athenians</hi> (as ſome ſuppoſe) but from <hi>Athenaea,</hi> in ancient time Lady of that Countrey, whoſe Tombe remaines to this day. Next to <hi>Athens</hi> is <hi>Archabis,</hi> and <hi>Apſarus</hi> an ancient City, three dayes journey from <hi>Rizaeum,</hi> in old time named <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrtus,</hi> from a man of that name ſlaine by the plots of <hi>Medea</hi> and <hi>Jaſon</hi> neer unto that place; but many ages and ſucceſſions of men have corrupted the memory of that act, and changed the name into <hi>Abſarus;</hi> on the Eaſt ſide of which City ſtands yet the Tombe of that <hi>Apſyrtus.</hi> It was anciently very populous, and had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Walls, and a <hi>Circus,</hi> and a Theatre, and ſuch other Ornaments of a great City. But of thoſe antiquities nothing now remaines but the Pavements: By this it appeares ſtrange, that any ſhould affirme that the <hi>Colchians</hi> were borderers to the <hi>Trapazuntians.</hi> For ſo may <hi>Jaſon</hi> be thought not to have fled home into <hi>Greece</hi> with <hi>Medea</hi> and the Golden fleece, but to have gone the quite contrary way to the <hi>Phaſis</hi> and furtheſt <hi>Barbarians.</hi> In the Raigne of <hi>Tra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Strabo</hi> and ſome others have ſpent much diſcourſe about them: But they ſeem to ſpeak moſt truly, who think that there was never any ſuch Manniſh race of Women; nor that Nature, in Mount <hi>Caucaſus</hi> only, ſwerves from its ſacred Lawes; but that the <hi>Barbarians</hi> of thoſe parts, making an expedition againſt <hi>Aſia,</hi> brought their Wives with them, whom they left in a Camp neer <hi>Thermodon:</hi> And that themſelves over-running much of <hi>Aſia,</hi> were encountred, and ſo defeated, that none eſcaped to the Camp; and that there the Wives being put to it by the feare of the People adjoyning, and by their want of Victuall, put on mens faces, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med themſelves with furniture left behind by their Husbands, and with the ſame performed ſome commendable Actions, compelled by neceſſity, till they were all ſlain. This is my Opinion, and that the <hi>Amazons</hi> were Wives who went to War with their Husbands; the experiment whereof hath happened in our time. And commonly the addictions which deſcend to Poſterity, are the Images of thoſe which were before. For the <hi>Hunnes,</hi> in their in-roads upon the <hi>Romans</hi> often coming to a Battell, wherein ſome of them were ſlain; and the <hi>Romans</hi> ſearching the dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, have found Women among them. Other Armies of Women were never, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther infeſting <hi>Aſia</hi> nor <hi>Europe.</hi> Neither was it ever heard that the <hi>Caucaſian</hi> Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines had all their men waſted at any time.

But they ſuffered much from the covetouſneſſe of their Princes; who took violently from the Parents ſuch Children as were beautifull, and made them <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> and ſold them to the <hi>Romans</hi> at great prices; then killed the Fathers, leaſt they might revenge their Children<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And thus the poor Wretches were ruined by the fatall handſomeneſſe of their Children: And hereby moſt of the <hi>Eunuchs</hi> of the Imperiall Palace were <hi>Abaſgians.</hi> But in the now Raigne of <hi>Juſtinian</hi> all hath been changed for the <hi>Abaſgians</hi> to the milder and more civill. They have received the Chriſtian Religion; And the Emperour ſent <hi>Euphratas</hi> his <hi>Eunuch</hi> expreſly to admoniſh their Princes, to force out no more the virility of humane nature with Iron, and the <hi>Abaſgians,</hi> bold upon this injunction of the Emperour, have oppoſed that courſe; which made it formerly their greateſt feare to be Fathers of handſome Sons.

               <p>Beyond the <hi>Sagines</hi> are many <hi>Hunniſh</hi> Nations in a Country called <hi>Eulyſia,</hi> poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by thoſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> in the Maritime and mid-land parts thereof to the Lake of <hi>Maeotis,</hi> and River of <hi>Tanais,</hi> which diſembogues into the ſaid Lake, and the Lake into the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea.

Lately they ſent foure Ambaſſadours to <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> for a Biſhop to be given them, as to the <hi>Abaſgians:</hi> And the Emperour diſmiſt them with ſatisfaction in what they deſired.

The planting of theſe <hi>Tetraxites</hi> in that Country was thus.

On the ſaid other ſide neer unto the ſhore of the ſaid Lake and ſtraits, were formerly ſeated the <hi>Tetraxite Goths,</hi> and not far from them the <hi>Goths,</hi> and <hi>Viſigoths,</hi> and <hi>Vandales,</hi> and all the other <hi>Gothick</hi> Nations, anciently named <hi>Scythians,</hi> as all the other Nations of thoſe parts, with ſome difference in ſome of <hi>Sarmatians, Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claenians,</hi> and other names. Theſe People have a tradition, if it be true, that ſome <hi>Cimmerian</hi> young men hunting a Stag, it took the water; and that they either ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger upon their ſport, or driven by ſome Spirit, followed the Stage to the oppoſite ſhore: where the ſame (whatſoever it were) ſuddainly vaniſht, as having ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to no other end, but to bring a miſchiefe upon the Inhabitants there. The
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:50471:137"/>young men, (they ſay) though they miſt their game, found matter for warre and booty.

Such as eſcaped paſt the river <hi>Iſter</hi> with their wives and children into the Roman territory, where they did much miſcheif. Afterward the Emperour planted them in a country of <hi>Thrace;</hi> and ſometimes they aided the <hi>Romans</hi> in the quality of Confederates, receiving yearly penſions: whereby it appeares, that the <hi>Goths</hi> came not as men conquer'd, but upon the articles of a League, (The <hi>Romans</hi> calling Leagues after a war, <hi>Foedera.</hi>) Sometime alſo they made cauſeleſſe war upon the <hi>Romans,</hi> till under <hi>Theoderick</hi> they removed into <hi>Italy.</hi>

               <p>Next to the aforeſaid Nations is <hi>Boſporus,</hi> a maritime city, lately become ſubject to the <hi>Romans.</hi> From <hi>Boſporus</hi> to <hi>Cherſone</hi> a maritime City alſo, and formerly ſubject to the <hi>Romans,</hi> all between is poſſeſt by <hi>Hunniſh</hi> nations. <hi>Cepi</hi> alſo, and <hi>Phanaguris,</hi> two cities, were formerly under the <hi>Romans,</hi> almoſt untill our time; but the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring <hi>Barbarians</hi> took, them and utterly ruined them.

               <p>The River <hi>Iſter</hi> ſprings from the mountaines in <hi>Gaule,</hi> and skirting by <hi>Italy,</hi> and deſcending through <hi>Dacia, Illyrium,</hi> and <hi>Thrace;</hi> it diſembogues into the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea.

               <p>And here I think it not unſeaſonable to ſet down the diſpute among the Learned, concerning the bounds of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Europe.</hi> Some think the River of <hi>Tanais</hi> doth ſever theſe two continents, and alleadge that diviſion to be naturall. For the Sea com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the weſtern lands to the Eaſtern; the <hi>Tanais,</hi> from the North croſſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia;</hi> and the <hi>Egyptian Nile,</hi> from the South between <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Affrick;</hi> others reject this reaſon as weak, ſaying, that the ſtraits of <hi>Caliz</hi> diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes at firſt theſe two continents, and that the <hi>Mediterranian</hi> ſtill leaves <hi>Africk</hi> and <hi>Aſia</hi> on the right hand, and <hi>Europe</hi> on the left, till it come to the Ends of the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea.

If ſome River muſt divide them, it can be no other then the river <hi>Phaſis;</hi> which deſcending direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opoſite to the ſtraits of <hi>Caliz,</hi> cuts between thoſe two continents,; as thoſe ſtraits alſo have them on each ſide of it; opening from the Ocean to the midland Seas. And the <hi>Phaſis</hi> likewiſe entring at the end of that part of the midland Seas, called <hi>Pontus Euxinus,</hi> manifeſtly receives from the Sea the continuation of dividing the Earth. This laſt opinion challenges antiquity, aſwell as the other. For indeed, men poſſeſt of ſome ancient learning in a thing, commonly have not the patience to ſearch long touching the truth of it, nor will endure new opinions. To them ever the ancienter the things are, the truer they ſeem, and they deride all of their own time as deſpicable. But the queſtion now is not about Intelligences, and Intelligibles, nor ſuch obſcurites; but of a River and a country, which time could neither change nor conceal: Neither herein is there any thing can hinder a diligent ſearcher from finding the truth.

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:50471:138"/>thus ſtrangely in <hi>Straits,</hi> becauſe the tyde is contracted in a narrow paſſage between two lands, and ſo falls into thoſe neceſſities, whereof no reaſon appeares: And ſo the coming of a current from <hi>Hieron</hi> to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> is no argument that the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean</hi> and <hi>Euxine</hi> Seas have there their endings. The ſaid reaſon hath no naturall foundation; but there alſo the narrowneſſe of the ſtraits muſt carry it: And the fiſhermen of that coaſt find that current to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to be only upon the upper part of the water (which is ſeen by us) and towards the bottome quite contrary: Where finking their Drags, they find them carried up to <hi>Hieron</hi> by the tyde below. But in <hi>Lazica</hi> the Land beats the tyde directly back again (whereas by all other ſhores it paſſes on ſide-long) and there only cauſes it both to ſtay its courſe, and to retire; as if the Creator had there ſets its limits. The Sea touching that ſhore runnes no further, and riſes no higher, though from all ſides ſupplied with numberleſſe Rivers, and ſome great ones; but back it goes, as being extended to its juſt meaſure, and keeping its bounds and limits in (as it were) by the awfull neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſome Law, the articles whereof it is carefull not to tranſgreſſe.

               <p>BUT why <hi>Choſroes</hi> was ſo deſiroust of <hi>Lazica,</hi> having ſayd ſomething before, I will now relate what moſt induced him, having thus deſcribed the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd Countries, and thereby made my diſcourſe more cleer. The <hi>Perſians</hi> often had invaded the <hi>Roman</hi> Territories under <hi>Choſroes,</hi> and done miſcheifes there not to be expreſſed: But they got little by it, but came home ſtill with much loſſe of their men and eſtates, whereupon at their returne into <hi>Perſia</hi> they mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured againſt <hi>Choſroes,</hi> calling him the ruiner of their Nation. Once coming home out of <hi>Lazica,</hi> and being fallen into ſome deſperate extremities, they were ready to mutiny; and had ſlaine him, if he had not foreſeen it, and warded it, by gaining the principall of them with faire words. And being deſirous to finde ſome reall Apologie, he was ſtudious to procure ſome notable advantage to the <hi>Perſian</hi> Empire. He attempted the City of <hi>Daras,</hi> but was repulſed (as I have ſayd) and he deſpaired to get it, either by ſurprize, the Guards being well kept, or by a ſiege. There being ſtill in <hi>Daras</hi> all Proviſions layd up in ſtore for a long time: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides neer it riſes a Spring in a Rocky ground, which makes a pretty River, deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding directly into the City: an no Enemy can divert it, nor force it another way, by reaſon of the Rocks. Being within the City it goes round about it, and having filled their Ponds and Ciſternes, it goes out againe, and cloſe unto the Town-wals falls into a bottomleſſe pit, and is ſeen no more, nor hitherto knowes any man where it riſes againe. This pit was not alwayes there, but it happened thus, long after the building of <hi>Doras</hi> by <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> the Emperour. By reaſon of this natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſituation of the place, they who beſiege it are afflicted with much want of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: So that <hi>Choſroes</hi> failing in this attempt, thought of taking ſome other <hi>Roman</hi> Towne; but farr within the <hi>Roman</hi> Territories to ſit downe before any City, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo many ſtrong places at his back, he thought it impoſſible. For this reaſon he layd <hi>Antioch</hi> flat with the ground, and quitted the <hi>Roman</hi>-Territories, ſo that his thoughts mounted after hopes further off, and full of difficulty. For hearing how the <hi>Barbarians</hi> ſeated on the left hand of the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea, about the Lake of <hi>Maeotis,</hi> doe without controule over-run the <hi>Roman</hi> Provinces; he thought alſo by having <hi>Lazica</hi> to paſſe unto <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> it ſelfe, without croſſing the Sea, as well as thoſe <hi>Barbarians.</hi> And for this cauſe the <hi>Perſians</hi> ſtrive to get <hi>Lazica.</hi> But to returne from whence I digreſſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Corianes</hi> with the <hi>Perſian</hi> army encamped by the River of <hi>Hippis,</hi> and againſt them <hi>Gubazes</hi> King of <hi>Lazica,</hi> and <hi>Dagiſthaeus</hi> commander of the <hi>Roman</hi> army, led their forces of <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Lazians.</hi> They paſt the ſaid River, and being there incam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, they conſulted whether they ſhould ſtay there, or receive the Enemy marching them, or ſhould march againſt the Enemy, and by giving demonſtration of the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:50471:139"/>and by beginning the fight, charge them with leſſe apprehenſion of danger themſelves, and abate the Enemies ſpirits. This counſell prevailed that they ſhould charge them, and on they went: But the <hi>Lazians</hi> refuſed to joyne with the <hi>Roman</hi> Troops, who, they ſayd, were not to fight for their Countrey and deareſt pledges, themſelves adventuring for Wives and Children, and their native ſoyle: So that being overcome, they ſhould be aſhamed to look upon their Wives; by which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, valour (in caſe they had none) would grow in them. And they would have the firſt charge, leaſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> who could not have an equall eagerneſſe to theirs, ſhould in the fight break their orders. <hi>Gubazes</hi> being glad to ſee his <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zians</hi> ſo gallant, called them together at ſome diſtance from the <hi>Romans,</hi> and ſpake thus.</p>

And there is no hardneſſe in things, we have been uſed to; the toilſomeneſſe thereof being ſpent in our former practiſe. So that we muſt not apprehend an Enemy often beaten; as being now not ſo vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant as they were before; and a ſpirit once dejected, commonly neve riſing again. With theſe conſiderations therefore, encounter the Enemy with courage.</q> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus ſaid, he led them on. The army was thus ordered. The <hi>Lazian</hi> horſe were ſet in the front, and a good diſtance behind them came on the <hi>Roman</hi> horſe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by <hi>Philegagus</hi> a <hi>Gepaede,</hi> a valiant man, and by <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Armenian,</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Guzes,</hi> formerly ſpoken of by me, an extraordinary good ſouldier. In the rear came <hi>Gubazes,</hi> and the King of the <hi>Lazians,</hi> and <hi>Dagiſthaeus,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Generall, with their foot; that if the horſe were routed, they might eſcape unto them. <hi>Corianes</hi> on the other ſide ſent a thouſand choice men well arm'd to diſcover, himſelf marching after them, and leaving only ſome few to guard the camp. The <hi>Lazians</hi> being fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, and coming to the buſineſſe, gave the lye to their former confidence. For lighting ſuddenly upon the Enemies Avant-coureurs, they being unable to withſtand them, came gallopping all back in confuſion, and mingled with the <hi>Roman</hi> Horſe; glad to fly to thoſe, with whom before they made ſcruple to be ranckt. Both the Cavalleries being neer, they joyned not battell, but each, when the Enemy came on, gave back, and ſet on them retiring, and ſo ſpent much time in renewing charges, and in quick turns and returnes. In the <hi>Roman</hi> army was one <hi>Artaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> a <hi>Perſarmenian,</hi> revolted lately to the <hi>Roman</hi> army, having ſecured his faith by the killing of a hundred and twenty <hi>Perſian</hi> Souldiers. He got acceſſe to <hi>Valerianus,</hi> then Generall of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and deſired of him fifty <hi>Romans,</hi> with whom he went to a Caſtle in <hi>Perſarmenia,</hi> guarded by a hundred and twenty <hi>Perſians;</hi> who received him with his men, not knowing of his revolt. This Garriſon they killed, and returned to <hi>Valerianus;</hi> and <hi>Artabanes</hi> appearing by this ſure and firm to the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in their warrs. In this incounter he put himſelf between the armies accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with two <hi>Romans;</hi> againſt them came ſome Enemies, whom <hi>Artabanes</hi> charging killed a <hi>Perſian,</hi> valiant, and of a ſtrong body, and threw him from his Horſe to the ground. A <hi>Barbarian</hi> ſtanding next, ſtrake <hi>Artabanes</hi> with his Sword upon the head, but no mortall blow. One of <hi>Artabanes</hi> two Companions, a <hi>Goth,</hi> while the <hi>Perſians</hi> hand was yet over the head of <hi>Artabanes,</hi> thruſt him into the left flanck and killed him. The thouſand that were ſent out at this retired, and ſtayd for <hi>Corianes,</hi> and the reſt of the Army of <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Alans,</hi> and ſoon after they joyned: Then came up the Infantry both of <hi>Gubazes</hi> and <hi>Dagiſthaeus</hi> to the Horſe, and the fight came to handy blowes. <hi>Philegagus</hi> and <hi>John</hi> finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves too weak for the Enemies horſe, and having ſeen what the <hi>Lazians</hi> could do,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:50471:139"/>lighted, and cauſed the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Lazians</hi> to do the like; and with the foot they ſtood in a deep battallion oppoſite to the Enemy and charging with their Lances. The <hi>Perſians</hi> being not able to charge the Enemy being on foot, nor to break their Battallion, and their Horſes flying back, troubled with the heads of the Lances and noiſe of the ſheilds, they truſted with the multitude of their arrowes to break them. The <hi>Romans</hi> alſo, and the <hi>Lazians</hi> let fly their arrowes, and they coming thick, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were ſlain on both ſides. The <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Alans</hi> diſcharged oftner; but the arrowes for the moſt part rebounded from the <hi>Romans</hi> ſheilds. <hi>Corianes,</hi> the <hi>Perſian</hi> Generall, was ſhot into the neck' (by whom it was not known) of which he dyed inſtantly; and his death ſwayed the victory to the <hi>Romans</hi> ſide: For the falling from his horſe, forthwith the <hi>Perſians</hi> ran away to their camp. The <hi>Romans</hi> purſued, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led many, and hoped to take the Enemies camp at firſt aſſault; But an <hi>Alan</hi> a ſtrong man, &amp; very expert to ſhoot backward and forward, put himſelf into the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roweſt entrance into the Trenches, and ſtopt the invaders a long time; untill <hi>John Guzes</hi> killed him with his Lance, and then the <hi>Romans</hi> took the Camp. Many <hi>Perſians</hi> there periſhed, the reſt returned home as they could. This was the ſucceſſe of that <hi>Perſian</hi> invaſion of <hi>Lazica.</hi> Another army alſo came, and victualled the Garriſon in <hi>Petra;</hi> and then retired home.</p>

               <p>IN the mean time the <hi>Lazians</hi> at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> accuſed <hi>Dagiſthaeus</hi> of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, and favouring the <hi>Perſians;</hi> and that by the perſwaſions of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> he forbare to aſſault that part of the Walls of <hi>Petra,</hi> which fell down, and that the while the Enemy fortified the breach with ſack-fuls of Sand laid one upon another: And that for money, or negligently he loſt his opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by putting of the aſſault, which he could never after recover. The Emperour upon this confined <hi>Dagiſthaeus</hi> to his houſe, and made <hi>Beſſas,</hi> lately come out of <hi>Italy,</hi> Generall of <hi>Armenia;</hi> whom he directed alſo to command the Army in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zica,</hi> ſent thither before under <hi>Venilus,</hi> Brother to <hi>Buzes,</hi> and <hi>Odonachus,</hi> and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi> the <hi>Thracian,</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ligangus</hi> an <hi>Herulian. Nabedes</hi> alſo came into <hi>Lazica</hi> with an Army, but effected nothing worth the mentioning; ſave only a defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Abaſgians</hi> from the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Lazians;</hi> and upon the occaſion of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there with an Army, the taking of ſixty Sons of their principall men for Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtages; and the taking Priſoner in his way <hi>Theodora</hi> in <hi>Apſilia,</hi> the Widow of <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites,</hi> late Uncle to <hi>Gubazes,</hi> and King of <hi>Lazica.</hi> She was by birth a <hi>Roman,</hi> the Kings of <hi>Lazica</hi> having long uſed by the Emperours conſent, to take Wives in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and to make allyances with ſundry Senators: And <hi>Gubazes</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was the Son of a <hi>Roman</hi> Lady. The reaſon moving the <hi>Abaſgians</hi> to revolt, was this. After they had (as I ſaid before) depoſed their Kings, ſome <hi>Roman</hi> Garriſons were by the Emperour laid upon the Country, who ſought to reduce it under the <hi>Roman</hi> Dominion, and exacted new things, uſing violent waies, which diſcontented the <hi>Abaſgians;</hi> And leaſt they ſhould be brought into ſlavery to the <hi>Romans,</hi> they ſet up Kings again: <hi>Opſites</hi> of the Eaſtern part of the Country and <hi>Scaparnas</hi> of the Weſtern. They were grown deſperate of any good, and ſo choſe rather to reſume their former condition, though bad, then to retain the worſe which ſucceeded; and fearing the <hi>Romans</hi> power, revolted ſecretly to the <hi>Perſian.</hi> But the Emperour perceiving it, commanded <hi>Beſſas</hi> to march againſt them: who ſent ſome choice numbers of his Army under <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ligangus,</hi> and <hi>John Guzes.</hi> One of the new Kings of <hi>Abaſgia</hi> had been lately ſent for into <hi>Perſia</hi> by <hi>Choſroes,</hi> where he then was. The other drew the <hi>Abaſgians</hi> together, and oppoſed the <hi>Roman</hi> invaſion. Upon the confines of <hi>Apſilia</hi> and way to <hi>Abaſgia,</hi> is a high Mountain, beginning at <hi>Caucaſus,</hi> and by degrees growing lower, till it ends in the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea. At the foot of this Mountain the <hi>Abaſgians</hi> have an ancient Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of a conſiderable bigneſſe, where they beat off any Enemy invading, the place being a great faſtneſſe, not poſſible to force. It hath one paſſage only, leading to this Caſtle, and into <hi>Abaſgia,</hi> not paſſable but by one man at once a foot. Under
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:50471:140"/>the ſaid foot-path, is a deep Vally reaching to the Sea, and very ſtony; which hath gotten a name ſutable for the roughneſſe, being called <hi>Trachea.</hi> The <hi>Roman</hi> Fleet came to the confines of <hi>Abaſgia,</hi> and <hi>Apſilia,</hi> where <hi>John</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ligangus</hi> landed their Forces, leaving the Sea-men to waite on them neer the Shore. They marcht afoot unto <hi>Trachea,</hi> and ſeeing the <hi>Abaſgians</hi> in Armes, and guarding the foot path, they were troubled. In the end <hi>John</hi> left there <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ligangus</hi> with halfe the Army, and himſelfe with the reſt went aboard the Barkes, and compaſſed the <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chea,</hi> ſo that he got the Backes of the Enemy. With Enſignes diſplayed he marcht againſt them, who perceiving themſelves charged on both ſides, reſiſted not, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred in confuſion, ſo hamperd with their feare and amazement, that they hardly found their owne Countrey wayes, nor eaſily got cleer of them. The <hi>Romans</hi> on both ſides had the execution, and killed many; and came running to the Caſtle, where they found the Guards ſhutting the Gates; but not able to put them to, and ſo ſtill receiving in the purſued and Purſuers, pell-mell, and not diſcerning <hi>Abaſgians</hi> from Enemies, and by reaſon of the croud being not able to cloſe the Gates, the <hi>Abaſgians,</hi> who were ſo glad to get within the walls, were taken with the caſtle. Yet the <hi>Romans,</hi> when they thought themſelves maſters of the Enemy, found a difficulty: for the houſes ſtanding cloſe to one another, the <hi>Abaſgians</hi> mounted the ſame, and ſhot down upon their heads, and defended themſelves ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, out of fear and pitty of their wives and children, till the <hi>Romans</hi> ſet the houſes on fire, and ſo became abſolute victors. <hi>Opſites,</hi> King of the <hi>Abaſgians,</hi> fled with ſome few to the neighbouring <hi>Hunnes,</hi> and to mount <hi>Caucaſus:</hi> The reſt were conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to aſhes, or made priſoners. The <hi>Romans</hi> took both the Kings wives, and all their children, demoliſht the Caſtle, and almoſt emptied the country: This was the ſucceſſe of the <hi>Abaſgians</hi> revolt.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Apſilians,</hi> being anciently ſubject to the <hi>Lazians,</hi> have in their country a ſtrong Caſtle called <hi>Tzibulum;</hi> which <hi>Terdites,</hi> Maſter of the Palace in <hi>Lazica,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving offended the King, and being diſcontented, agreed to betray to the <hi>Perſians;</hi> and getting ſome <hi>Perſian</hi> forces ready, he went into <hi>Apſilia.</hi> Being neer the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, he rode afore with his company of <hi>Lazians,</hi> and got in, the Garriſon not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſting a principall Officer of <hi>Lazica.</hi> And thus <hi>Terdites,</hi> ſo ſoon as the <hi>Perſian</hi> forces came up, received them into the Caſtle; and the <hi>Perſians</hi> now held themſelves Maſters, not only of <hi>Lazica,</hi> but of <hi>Apſilia</hi> alſo; while the <hi>Romans</hi> being buſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Petra,</hi> and to incounter the <hi>Perſian</hi> army, had no meanes to ſend ſuccours. But the Governour of that Caſtle had a fair wife, by birth an <hi>Apſilian,</hi> with whom the commander of the <hi>Perſian</hi> forces fell fondly in love; and when with his temptations he could not gain her, he attempted to force her; which ſo inraged her husband, that he killed him, and ſacrificed alſo his Company to their commanders luſt, and took the Caſtle to himſelf. Hereupon the <hi>Apſilians</hi> took occaſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt from the <hi>Lazians,</hi> charging them for not coming to their ſuccours againſt the <hi>Perſians. Gubazes</hi> ſent againſt them a thouſand <hi>Romans,</hi> and <hi>John Guzes;</hi> who with fair words brought them back to their former obedience to the <hi>Lazians.</hi> And thus was it concerning the <hi>Apſilians,</hi> and the caſtle of <hi>Tzibulum.</hi>

               <p>ABOUT the ſame time, the cruelty of <hi>Choſroes</hi> toucht even upon his own blood. His eldeſt Son <hi>Anatozadus</hi> (which in the <hi>Perſian</hi> language ſignifies, Immortall) had much offended him with his lewd courſes, making no ſcruple to lye with his Fathers Wives. At firſt <hi>Choſroes</hi> chaſtiſed him with Baniſhment, and confined him to the City of <hi>Lapato,</hi> ſeven dayes journey from <hi>Cteſiphon,</hi> in a Province of <hi>Perſia</hi> called <hi>Vazaine,</hi> a very good country; and ſoon after fell ſick ſo dangerouſly, that he was reported to be dead; being of a ſickly conſtitution: and having Phyſitians about him ſtill of all countries, and among others <hi>Tribunus</hi> of <hi>Palaeſtina;</hi> a man famous for his art, and inferiour to none of his time, &amp; moreover a wiſe and a godly man, and very honeſt. He had formerly cured <hi>Choſroes</hi> &amp;
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:50471:140"/>came out of <hi>Perſia</hi> with many great preſents; but at the making of the <hi>Quinquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall</hi> ceſſation, <hi>Choſroes</hi> intreated the Emperour, to let him have <hi>Tribunus</hi> with him for one year; Who having performed his attendance, <hi>Choſroes</hi> bade him aske what he had a mind to. <hi>Tribunus</hi> inſtead of wealth, askt of him the liberty of ſome <hi>Roman</hi> captives; and got 3000 freed; beſides ſome men of quality, whom he demanded by name. By this act <hi>Tribunus</hi> got a great reputation among all men. <hi>Anatozadus</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his Fathers ſickneſſe, uſurped, and rebelled; and though his Father were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, yet he put the City into revolt, and keenly purſued the Warr. <hi>Choſroes</hi> ſent againſt him an army under <hi>Fabrizus,</hi> who won the battell; took <hi>Anatozadus</hi> Priſoner, and brought him to his Father. <hi>Choſroes</hi> blemiſhed the young mans eyes, not by taking away the ſight; but by diſtorting the eye-lids into much uglineſſe, with irons red hot, applied to the out ſide of the Eye-lids being ſhut. This <hi>Choſroes</hi> did, to cut off his hope of his Kingdome, the Law permitting not any man with any blemiſh to be King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> as I have ſaid before.</p>
               <p>Now alſo was the fifth year of the Ceſſation expired, and <hi>Juſtinian</hi> ſent unto <hi>Choſroes, Peter</hi> a Patritian, and his Maſter of the Palace with commiſſion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude an abſolute truce for the Eaſt. <hi>Choſroes</hi> diſmiſt him with promiſe to ſend one ſhortly to finiſh all, as ſhould be beſt for both: And ſoon after he ſent <hi>Iſdigunas</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; a man ſupercilious and arrogant, and whoſe inſolent puffing, and ſwelling was not tolerable to any <hi>Roman.</hi> He brought his wife and Brother with him, and a train ſo great, as if he were marching to a battell: He had alſo with him two principal <hi>Perſians,</hi> who wore Diadems of Gold upon their heads. The <hi>Conſtantinopolitans</hi> mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured to ſee the Emperour honour him ſomething more then according to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of an Ambaſſador. <hi>Bradicius</hi> the interpreter was not with him, whom they ſay <hi>Choſroes</hi> put to death, for preſuming to ſit at the ſame Table with the Emperour <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> who (ſaid he) would not have admitted an Interpreter to ſuch an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, if he had not betrayed the <hi>Perſian</hi> affaires. Some ſay, that <hi>Iſdigunas</hi> charged him with ſecret conferences with the <hi>Romans. Iſdigunas</hi> now at his audience, ſaid not a word of the peace; but complained of Tranſgreſſions againſt the Ceſſation; That <hi>Arethas,</hi> and the <hi>Saracen</hi> Confederates of the <hi>Romans</hi> committed ſpoiles upon <hi>Alamundarus,</hi> during the truce, and ſome other things of ſmal importance.</p>
               <p>In the meane time <hi>Beſſas</hi> ſate downe before <hi>Petra</hi> with the whole Army. The <hi>Romans</hi> mined in the ſame place where <hi>Dagiſthaeus</hi> formerly had done, and for the ſame reaſon: For the Walls are for the moſt part founded upon a Rock; but in ſome places upon earth. Towards the Weſt they are upon an impenetrable Rock, but not very thick, a peice whereof <hi>Dagiſthaeus</hi> then, and now <hi>Beſſas</hi> digged into; but the nature of the ground bounded their Mine, not permitting it to proceed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then it ſelfe. After the retreate of <hi>Dagiſthaeus,</hi> the <hi>Perſians</hi> had mended the fallen piece of their Wall there, by filling up that which had been digged into, with pebble ſtones, and placing over it great beames, ſmoothed and tyed together to a pretty breadth. This baſis of Timber was in ſtead of a foundation, and upon it was the Wall ſet: Which the <hi>Romans</hi> not knowing, thought their Mine to be quite under the foundation; and having voyded away much earth from beneath thoſe timbers, they ſhook indeed the Wall, and a part of it ſuddenly ſunk, but it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined not to either ſide, nor had one ſtone diſordered, but ſetled upright, whole and intire upon the digged ground, as if it had been let downe with an Engine; onely it was lower then before: And ſo the <hi>Romans</hi> could not aſſault the Towne; <hi>Mermeroes</hi> having formerly alſo with many hands raiſed all the Walls higher then ever. The <hi>Romans</hi> ſeeing the piece that ſunck, and ſtood upright ſo, were much troubled. Mine they could no more, neither could they bring the Ram to the Wall, the ground being ſteep, and the Ram not being to be drawne but in even ground. In the Army then chanced to be <hi>Sabirian Hunnes,</hi> who inhabite about the <hi>Cauca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Mountaines, and are populous, and divided into many Principalities. Some of their Princes are ancient freinds to the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, ſome to the King of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia;</hi> who give Penſions in Gold to their ſeverall Confederates, not yearely, but upon occaſions. The Emperour to his Confederates had lately ſent Gold for their ayde in this Warre: But the Meſſenger finding it unſafe to paſſe the <hi>Caucaſian</hi> Mountaines, and by an Enemy with Money, came to <hi>Beſſas</hi> before <hi>Petra,</hi> and from thence ſent to the <hi>Sabirians,</hi> to ſend ſome to receive the Money, who preſently-ſent
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:50471:141"/>three of their Princes into <hi>Lezica,</hi> and theſe were with the Army at the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault. When they ſaw the <hi>Romans</hi> deſpairing, they deviſed a new Engine, never thought of by the <hi>Romans</hi> nor <hi>Perſians,</hi> who notwithſtanding have had excellent Artiſts, and have often needed ſuch an Engine to aſſault places in ſtony and ſteep ground: But it never came into their minds; Mans nature ever proceeding with time to new inventions. As theſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> ſuddenly made a new faſhioned Ram, uſing no timbers upript, nor lying a croſſe, but in ſtead of them ſmall Poles tyed and ſitted together. They covered the whole Engine with Hides, and obſerved the perfect forme of an ordinary Ram, and in the midſt placed the uſuall Beam, with a topp headed with Iron, to batter the Walls: It was made ſo light that it needed no men or cattell to draw and thruſt it forward; onely forty men within it cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Hides, carryed the Engine with eaſe upon their ſhoulders, and winded up the Ram and let it go againſt the Walls. Such Engines now were framed by theſe three <hi>Barbarians,</hi> taking Beames and Iron worke from the <hi>Romans</hi> Ramms, which they could not bring neer the Walls, and forty men being put under each, they ſet it cloſe to the Walls. On either ſide of each ſtood men well armed with Corſlets and Morions, and with long Poles in their hands topt with great Iron Hooks, to draw off from the Walls the ſtones looſened and unjoynted by the ſtrokes of the Ram. The <hi>Romans</hi> with many puſhes of the ſame ſhook the Wall, and they with their Poles pull'd downe the looſe ſtones, and quickly the Town was in the point of being taken. But the <hi>Perſians</hi> upon the Wall ſet a wooden Tower (which they had long before prepared) full of their beſt men, having their heads and bodies all covered with Iron and with Corſlets, and veſſells full of Brimſtone, and <hi>Babylonian</hi> Pitch, and <hi>Naptha,</hi> a Drug uſed by the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and by the <hi>Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> called <hi>Medean oyle:</hi> Theſe Veſſells they ſired and threw upon the <hi>Romans</hi> Rams, which failed little to be all ſet on fire, and were ſaved by the men having the long Poles, who cleered away the fire ſtill; but long they could not think ſo to hold out, the fire being ſuch, that where it toucht it inſtantly burnt, if not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly caſt off.</p>

               <p>BUT <hi>Beſſas</hi> putting his Forces in Armes, cauſed ſcaling Ladders to be ſet to that part of the Wall which was ſunck; And himſelfe uſing no other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation but the example of his own Valour, being an old man above 70. yeares of age, he firſt mounted the Ladder. Here was a Fight ſo valiantly performed by both <hi>Romans,</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> as the like hath not been ſeen. The <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> amounted to about 2300 men, and the <hi>Romans</hi> were ſome 6000. On both ſides almoſt all were hurt, that were not ſlaine: the <hi>Romans</hi> forced their aſcent with all their power, and the <hi>Perſians</hi> with much toile, and after the killing of many on both ſides, were very neer to have quite beaten off the danger. Many <hi>Romans</hi> were ſlain at the tops of the Ladders, the Enemy ſtanding above them; and <hi>Beſſas</hi> himſelfe fell from the Ladder, whereat a great ſhout was made, the <hi>Perſians</hi> from all parts ſhooting at him, and his Lanciers ſtanding all cloſe about him, covering him, having their Murrions and Corſelets on, and with their Shields, making the form of a Roofe over him, and keeping off the Arrowes, which claſht upon their Armour, and ſnapt aſunder. And all was full of clamour, panting, and toile. The <hi>Romans,</hi> eager to bring off their Generall, ſhot thick at the Walls, and repreſt the Enemy. <hi>Beſſas</hi> could not get up for the Shields that were hold over him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an old man, fat and unweildly. Yet he loſt not his Spirits, but in that great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſuddenly adviſed that which preſerved himſelfe, and the <hi>Romans</hi> Affaires. He directed his Lanciers to drag him off by the legs, which they did, and went off with him, holding their Shields over one another, and drawing him away ſo far at once only, as not to be ſubject to the Enemies ſhot. <hi>Beſſas,</hi> ſo ſoon as he was in a ſafe place, roſe, and encouraging his Souldiers, gave on again, mounting again the Ladder himſelfe; and the <hi>Romans</hi> following him did very valiantly. The <hi>Perſians</hi> hereupon demanded time to quit the place, and to yeild it. But <hi>Beſſas</hi> ſuſpecting
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:50471:141"/>it to be cunning, in the mean time to fortifie the Walls, ſaid, that he could not ſtay the Fight; but he pointed to another part of the Walls, whether they might go with him, and parly while the Armies fought. They not entertaining the motion, the Fight was hotly purſued: Which continuing equall, another part of the Wall, where the <hi>Romans</hi> had formerly min'd, ſuddenly fell down. Many of both parts ran thither; The <hi>Romans,</hi> though divided, exceeded the Enemy in numbers, and preſt hard upon them: And the Perſians being charged in both places, and their fewneſſe by being divided appearing, did not equally indure the charge. While the Armies were toyling, and the Perſians unable to repell the eagerneſſe of the Romans, and the Romans abſolutely to force their entry; <hi>John Guzes</hi> left them fighting upon the ruined Wall, and with ſome <hi>Armenians</hi> his Country-men, moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Rock where the City was eſteemed impregnable; and forcing upon the Guards there, killed with his Lance one of the gallanteſt Perſians, and made the place acceſſible. In the mean time the Perſians in the wooden Tower, kindled ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Fire-veſſels, by flinging the ſame thick, to burn the Engines and men in them, notwithſtanding their long Poles. But a ſtrong Southern wind blew againſt them, and withall let afire one of the boards of the Tower: They within it, being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toyled, and full of tumult and diſorder, perceived not the Accident ſoon enough, (their buſineſſe taking from them their ſenſes,) and the flame kindling by little, and little, and with the <hi>Medean</hi> Oyle, and the other materials, burnt all the Tower, and the Perſians in it; who conſumed into Coales, fell down, ſome with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Town, ſome among the Roman Engines. At the ruined Wall alſo the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy grew faint, and gave back, and the Romans entred, and then was <hi>Petra</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely taken; only ſome 500. Perſians retired to the Cittadell. The reſt the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans took, being 730 men, of whom 18. only were unhurt in the Fight. Many Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans alſo fell, brave men, and among them <hi>John Guzes,</hi> valiantly entring the Town, was killed with a ſtone. The next morning the Romans beſieged the Perſians in the Cittadell, and propounded offers of ſafety unto them, and to give aſſurances for the ſame: But they rejected them, and reſolved to oppoſe, though they had no thought of ſubſiſting long; but they choſe to dye bravely. <hi>Beſſas</hi> was deſirous to draw them from this Opinion, and to perſwade them to live. He commanded a Roman Souldier to ſpeak to them to that purpoſe, as hee dictated it unto him; who being neer, ſaid thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Valiant</hi> Perſians, <hi>what mean you thus to pull on your own deſtruction? uſing a ſence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe endeavour to dye, and ſhaming the profeſſion of Valour; which never oppoſes unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible neceſſities, but wiſely yeilds to the Conquerour. It is not diſhonourable to obey your Fortune, and Live; Neceſſity having left no hope, excuſes the diſhonour, although one be put to the pooreſt Actions; pardon ever attending that which cannot be avoided. Inſoevident a danger, affect not therefore pride, nor ſacrifice your lives for a little vaine-glory. Think how men once dead revive not again; but that the living may in time recompoſe themſelves. Conſult therefore your laſt conſultation, and ſtudy your own good: Thoſe Counſels are ever beſt, wherein the adviſers have left it in their power to repent. We pitty this your ſtrugling under the Yoake, and ſpare you, ſo fond to dye. And while you are wanton and fooliſh in a caſe of life; wee, as</hi> Romans, <hi>and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, commiſerate you. If you live, the worſt that ſhall befall you, will be to change your Common-wealth for a better, and to have</hi> Juſtinian <hi>your Lord inſtead of</hi> Choſroes; <hi>and for this we give you our Faith. Murther not therefore your ſelves, having meanes to live; It is not excuſable thus to no purpoſe to be in love with diſmall things, which is not to be valiant, but to be weary of life. The valiant man endures, while from his ſufferings he expects advantage. Men commend a willing death, when ſome gallant hope is built upon it; But a precipitate end, is a raſh and uſeleſſe folly, and a vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious dying fooliſh: Wiſe men condemning ſuch a fond pretext of brave ſpirit. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider moreover, if herein you be not unthankfull to God; who if he Would have you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, would not have delivered you to men, who deſire your preſervation. Thus it is; and doe you adviſe, whether you be worthy to live or no.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Perſians would not ſo much as afford attention to this Counſell, as men willingly deafe. By the Generals direction therefore the Romans threw fire into the Cittadell, thinking ſo to bring them to yeild. But they, though beholding the miſchiefe, and knowing that certainly they would be all conſumed, and having no
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:50471:142"/>hope by reſiſting to eſcape, yet would not come into their Enemies hands; but pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſht all with the <hi>Cittadell;</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> wondring at it. How ſerious a buſineſſe <hi>Choſroes</hi> held <hi>Lazica</hi> to be, appeared by this his putting into <hi>Petra</hi> the choice and the braveſt of his men, and by ſtoring the ſame with ſo great a proportion of armes, that to every <hi>Roman</hi> ſouldiers ſhare upon the pillage fell five mens furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, beſides much burnt in the Cittadell. There was alſo found corn, and other ſalted proviſions for five years ſiege: Wine there was none; but ſome Beveridge, and ſtore of beans. The <hi>Romans</hi> wondred to find water coming from the <hi>Aquaeduct,</hi> till they underſtood the myſtery. For <hi>Choſroes</hi> having taken <hi>Petra,</hi> and placed a Garriſon in it; foreſeeing the ſiege, and that doubtleſſe the <hi>Romans</hi> would attempt the <hi>Aquaeduct,</hi> divided the water, brought from it to the City, into three parts, by making a deep Sewer, and by building three ſeverall <hi>Aquaeducts;</hi> the one at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the Sewer up to the middle of it, covered with ſtones and Earth; above that a ſecond covered alſo, and a third above Ground and viſible. The <hi>Romans</hi> not underſtanding thoſe cloſe conveiances, ſpoiled the uppermoſt at the beginning of the ſiege, not working downward to the other, thinking the water did fail the City by what they had done; and from their loathneſſe to work, their wits failed them. The ſiege continuing, the <hi>Romans</hi> underſtood by ſome priſoners, that the beſieged had water from the <hi>Aquaeduct</hi> ſtill; whereupon digging, they found the ſecond Conduit and cut it, and in their ſecond Errour were not admoniſhed by their firſt. But now the city being taken, and finding the water ſtill coming in, and from their Priſoners, hearing how it was done; they ſaw too late their Enemies providence, and their own negligence. The Priſoners <hi>Beſſas</hi> ſent all to the Emperour, and threw down the Walls of <hi>Petra,</hi> that the Enemy might put them to no more buſineſſe about it: which the Emperour approved, &amp; commended him both for his valour, and this wiſe counſell of his. Thus <hi>Beſſas,</hi> by his good fortune, and the great valour ſhewed in this action, grew into a great reputation again: when he commanded <hi>Rome,</hi> there was great hope of him, having done very valiantly in former imployments. After his ill fortune at <hi>Rome</hi> (the ſame being ſackt by the <hi>Goths,</hi> and the whole ſtrength of the <hi>Romans</hi> there being well nigh deſtroyed) yet at his return to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the Emperour made him Generall againſt the <hi>Perſians;</hi> though the world flouted the Emperours reſolution herein, in committing the <hi>Perſian</hi> war to an old man allmoſt in his Grave, and one who had been ſo groſly beaten by the <hi>Goths;</hi> but notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this generall opinion, <hi>Beſſas</hi> uſed the valour, and found the good fortune, I have ſaid. So are humane affaires determined, not as men imagine; but as God ſwayes the Ballance: And this men call Fortune; finding accidentall things to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in a way by them not diſcerned, and ſo attributing a name of Fortune to things above their own reaſon.</p>

               <p>IN the mean time <hi>Mermeroes,</hi> afraid of <hi>Petra,</hi> was coming with his army thither ſo ſoon as the winter was done, and the ſeaſon was ſit; but hearing what was become of it, he ſtaid his journey, knowing how on that ſide of the <hi>Phaſis</hi> the <hi>Lazians</hi> had no Town, but <hi>Petra.</hi> So that he marcht homeward, having pre-poſſeſt the paſſages in <hi>Lazica,</hi> from <hi>Iberia:</hi> and he paſt over the <hi>Phaſis,</hi> where he found it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, and over another River called <hi>Reon.</hi> Having now the <hi>Phaſis</hi> to his right hand, be led his army to <hi>Archaeopolis</hi> (the cheif city of <hi>Lazica</hi>) being moſt horſe, and with eight Elephants, which the <hi>Perſians</hi> uſe as a Tower to ſtand upon, and ſhoot upon the Enemies heads. The <hi>Perſians</hi> induſtry alſo is worthy admiration; having made the way between <hi>Iberia</hi> and <hi>Lazica</hi> (which was unpaſſable for rocky places, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with thick woods and buſhes; that there was no going for a man a foot) now ſo plain and eaſie, that not only their Horſes, but their Elephants may paſſe. There came alſo 12000 <hi>Sabirian Hunnes</hi> to <hi>Mermeroes;</hi> who fearing leaſt their multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude would not obey him, but might do him ſome miſcheif rather, he kept 4000 of them, and ſent the reſt home with good ſtore of mony: The <hi>Roman</hi> army <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

After his victory at <hi>Petra,</hi> if he had made haſte to fortifie the paſſages into <hi>Lazica</hi> from <hi>Iberia,</hi> the <hi>Perſians</hi> had not entred <hi>Lazica,</hi> which he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as good as delivered to the Enemy by his neglect, and careleſneſſe of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours indignation. Who indeed uſed much to connive at the Errours of his cheif Miniſters, and they from thence committed many, both in the courſes of their lives, and in their Governments. The two Caſtles of <hi>Scanda</hi> and <hi>Sarapanis,</hi> in <hi>Lazica,</hi> about the frontier of <hi>Iberia,</hi> ſtanding upon two paſſages very hard to get through, the <hi>Lazians</hi> had demoliſht. Theſe Caſtles <hi>Juſtinian</hi> in the beginning of the War guarded with <hi>Romans,</hi> taking out the <hi>Lazians</hi> formerly in it; but the <hi>Romans</hi> wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting victuall, and being not able like the <hi>Lazians</hi> to live long upon <hi>Elymus,</hi> a kind of pulſe like mill-ſeed; the <hi>Lazians</hi> alſo being weary of bringing Proviſion upon their backs (there being no paſſage for horſes) the <hi>Romans</hi> there abandoned them, and the <hi>Perſians</hi> took them; but upon the truce reſtored them to <hi>Juſtinian</hi> for the Forts of <hi>Bolum</hi> and <hi>Pharangium,</hi> as I have ſaid before. But the <hi>Lazians</hi> having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſht them now, the <hi>Perſians</hi> repaired <hi>Scanda,</hi> and held it at this coming of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meroes</hi> into <hi>Lazica.</hi> And entring the ſame from <hi>Iberia,</hi> the firſt Towne you meet with in the Plaine, is <hi>Rodopolis,</hi> very aſſaultable; whereupon the <hi>Lazians</hi> demoliſht it, fearing the <hi>Perſian</hi> Invaſion; ſo that now <hi>Mermeroes</hi> marcht on to <hi>Archaeopolis.</hi> But he would not ſit downe before it, fearing the <hi>Romans</hi> Army at his back, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camping neer the <hi>Phaſis.</hi> Towards them he went firſt, and paſſing by <hi>Archaeopolis</hi> told them, That he meant to make a viſit to the <hi>Romans</hi> upon the <hi>Phaſis,</hi> and that done, would come to them againe. They anſwered him bravely, and bade him go, and that if he ſpake once with the <hi>Romans</hi> there, he would never come back to them. But the Commanders of the Roman Army hearing the newes, and finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves too weak, went aboard their Darks, carrying with them what they could, and throwing the reſt into the River. Soon after came <hi>Mermeroes,</hi> and was very melancholly to ſee the <hi>Romans</hi> Camp with not a man in it; he burnt the ſame, and in much anger led his Army back to <hi>Archaeopolis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This City ſtands upon a kind of Rock, and by it runs a River deſcending from the next Mountaines. The <hi>Low</hi> Gate opens neer the foot of the Rock, and the ground to it from the Plaine riſes onely, but makes no difficulty of acceſſe. The Gate opening toward the Rock is very hard to approach, having alſo for a great way thereabout great Thickets. The towne Walls were built up to the River, that they may draw up their water, having none within the Towne. <hi>Mermcroes</hi> was eager to aſſault, and finding it riſing ground, not to be medled with by ordinary Rams, he cauſed his <hi>Sabirians</hi> to make Rams portable on mens ſhoulders, uſing the advantage of his Enemies experiment thereof at <hi>Petra,</hi> which he had heard of. And theſe <hi>Sabirians</hi> made ſuch Rams as their Countrey-men in league with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> made then. <hi>Mermeroes</hi> ſet againſt the rocky part of the City the <hi>Delomites,</hi> a people dwelling in the midſt of <hi>Perſia,</hi> among unacceſſable Mountaines, and ſo not ſubject to the <hi>Perſian,</hi> but free; and in the <hi>Perſians</hi> wars they ſerve them for pay, being all foot men, with ſword and ſheild and two Javelins; and are nimble to climbe rocks, and to runne along the ſides of mountaines, as upon plain Ground. Theſe being there ordered, <hi>Mermeroes</hi> with the reſt of his army aſſaulted at the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er gate, and with his new Rams, and his Elephants. Where the <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Sabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> galled the <hi>Romans</hi> with their ſhot, making them almoſt to quit the Battlements, and the <hi>Delomites</hi> did as much on their ſide with their Javelins, that the <hi>Romans</hi> were in much extremity. <hi>Odonachus</hi> and <hi>Babas</hi> (were it to ſhew their own, or try the <hi>Romans</hi> reſolution, or by ſome inſtinct) leaving ſome few upon the Battlements, drew together the reſt, and ſayd thus to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Fellow Souldiers! you ſee our danger; but nevertheleſſe you muſt nor yeild to it: Nothing preſerves men deſpairing of life, but not to be in love with life: which ſond love is commonly attended with deſtruction. Conſider how in ſuch a difficulty as this, it is not ſafe to reſiſt an Enemy from the Battlements of a Towne: We may do it bravely, but the diſtance of place will not permit us to
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:50471:143"/>uſe our valour: The beſt we can get, is, to get off and retyre: But if we fight bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, to body, courage is it gets the better there, and the Victory goes with valour. They who get the better from a Wall, gaine not much; for the next day the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger renues as freſh as ever, and ſo they periſh by little and little, and looſe at laſt their defended Fortreſſes. But who overcome in a ſtanding fight, are ever after ſecure. Taking this into our thoughts, let us make a brave ſally, truſting in Gods aſſiſtance, and hoping well even from the deſpaire wee are in. God preſerves thoſe moſt, who have no hope left in themſelves.</q>

                  <hi>ODONACH<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi> and <hi>Babas</hi> having thus fayd, led out the Army: Some they left behinde, having ſuſpition of one of the cheife Inhabitants of the City, a <hi>Lazian;</hi> who had been treated with by <hi>Mermeroes</hi> in the heat of the aſſault, to ſet the City-Magazines on fire. <hi>Mermeroes</hi> by this thought either to enter the Towne with leſſe oppoſition, the <hi>Romans</hi> being buſie to quench the fire, or if, being eager to defend the Towne, they neglected the fire, he ſhould deprive them of their ſtores, and ſo eaſily in time get the Towne by Famine. The <hi>Lazian</hi> according to his promiſe to <hi>Mermeroes,</hi> when he ſaw the aſſault at the hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, fired the <hi>Store-houſes.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> left behinde, ſeeing the flame riſe, ran to it, and with much toyle, and ſome hurt, put it out. Thoſe who ſallyed, frighted the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy with the ſuddenneſſe, and killed them without reſiſtance. For the <hi>Perſians</hi> ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected no ſally from ſo few Defendants, and were ſcatterd, and in diſorder as upon an aſſault: Some with the Ramms upon their ſhoulders, and without their armes: others could do no Execution with their bowes, the <hi>Romans</hi> at the firſt running up cloſe unto them; who ſlaſht with their Swords on all ſides, and cut them in peices. One of their Elephants alſo, either wounded, or otherwiſe ſtarting, flew back, and caſt his riders, breaking the rancks, and driving the <hi>Perſians</hi> backward; whiſe the <hi>Romans</hi> ſecurely cut off all in their way. It may ſeem ſtrange, that the <hi>Romans</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo well the means of reſiſting Elephants, did nothing now; confounded (it ſeems) with the preſent buſineſſe. The means is that, which was practiſed upon <hi>Choſroes</hi> at <hi>Edeſſa:</hi> an Elephant there was brought cloſe to the walls, with many of the gallanteſt <hi>Perſians</hi> upon it: and appearing like a Tower, and the ſhot from it being made di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly upon the Defendants heads, the taking of the town was certainly expected: when the <hi>Romans</hi> eſcaped this danger, only by hanging out a Hog from the Bulwark, which with his ſqueaking ſcared the Elephant ſo, that he turned about and retired fair and ſoftly home. This now was omitted by the <hi>Romans;</hi> but their good fortune ſupplied their negligence. Having mentioned here <hi>Edeſſa,</hi> let me tell a ſtrange pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy which happened in that City a little before the breaking of the Perpetuall Peace; which was, the delivering of a woman with a child having two heads: the events ſince have made the meaning manifeſt. For the Eaſt, and much of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire beſides, have been diſputed by two Emperours; but to return to the fight. The <hi>Perſians</hi> being thus diſordered, and they in the rear ſeeing the confuſion in the van, and not knowing the matter, ran away in fear. The <hi>Dolomites</hi> alſo, who were upon high Ground, and ſaw all, ran away ſhamefully, and the overthrow was cleer. Four thouſand <hi>Perſians</hi> were ſlain, and three principall commanders, and four En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes were taken, which were ſent to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> They loſt 20000 horſes, not all in fight; but being ſpent with running away, and not getting a belly full of meat in <hi>Lazica,</hi> they dyed with famine and weakneſſe</p>
               <p>

The Caſtle was called by the <hi>Grecians Cotyaeum,</hi> but now by the <hi>Lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans Cotaeſis,</hi> as <hi>Arrianus</hi> in his hiſtory.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>chimerium,</hi> and from marching into the countries of <hi>Suania,</hi> and <hi>Scymnia,</hi> ſubject to the <hi>Perſians;</hi> an Army in <hi>Muchiriſis,</hi> croſſing the paſſage into thoſe countries.

               <p>In <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> in the mean time <hi>Iſdigunas</hi> the <hi>Perſian</hi> Ambaſſador, had many conferences with the Emperour touching a peace. And after a long time ſpent in diſputes, at laſt they came to this agreement: <q>That in their proper Dominions there ſhould be a ceſſation of armes for five years, and during the ſame, that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to each other they ſhould endeavour to compoſe the differences concerning <hi>Lazica</hi> and the <hi>Saracens;</hi> and that the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould pay to the <hi>Perſians</hi> twenty <hi>Centenaries</hi> of Gold for this Ceſſation of five yeares, and for the eighteen months paſſed between the end of the firſt <hi>Quinquenniall</hi> Ceſſation, and their ſending Ambaſſadors to each other ſixe <hi>Centenaries</hi> more; the <hi>Perſians</hi> alleadging, that they yeilded to a conference for truce upon that Condition.</q> Theſe twenty <hi>Cente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, Iſdigunas</hi> would have preſently paid, and the Emperour demanded to pay them by four <hi>Centenaries</hi> every year, and thereof to give caution; but in the end the <hi>Romans</hi> paid down the whole ſumme, that they might not ſeem to pay a yearly Tribute to the <hi>Perſians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus men are aſhamed more of the diſhonour of names, then things. <hi>Barſabes</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, a <hi>Perſian</hi> of great quality, and much favoured by <hi>Choſroes,</hi> whom <hi>Valerianus</hi> had taken priſoner in a fight in <hi>Armenia,</hi> and ſent to <hi>Conſtantionople,</hi> and for whom <hi>Choſroes</hi> had offered a great ranſome, was now ſet at liberty upon the ſuit of <hi>Iſdigunas,</hi> who promiſed to perſwade <hi>Choſroes</hi> to remove his army out of <hi>Lazica.</hi> This Ceſſation concluded in the twenty fifth year of <hi>Juſtinians</hi> Raigne, much diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented the <hi>Romans,</hi> whether unreaſonable or no, (as Subjects uſe to cenſure the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Princes) I will not determine. But they alleadged, that the <hi>Perſians</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now ſtrong in <hi>Lazica,</hi> they might ſecurely without the interruption of any, for five years to come, hold the faireſt peices of it, and that the <hi>Romans</hi> would never afterward be able to drive them out of it, but the <hi>Perſians</hi> have eaſy acceſſe even to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> it ſelfe. Theſe conſiderations troubled moſt men, but they could not help it; and likewiſe to ſee the ancient indeavour of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> to make the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> tributary, which by war they could never hope to effect, now eſtabliſhed by the colour of a ceſſation of armes; <hi>Choſroes</hi> now taxing the <hi>Romans</hi> with a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of four annuall <hi>Centenaries</hi> upon this fair pretence, untill his forty ſix <hi>Cente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries</hi> were paid, calling his Taxe a Truce, and ſhewing apparantly to have plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it from the beginning of the War. And yet ſtill he uſed hoſtility in <hi>Lazica,</hi> as hath been ſaid. From this Taxation the <hi>Romans</hi> had no hope ever to be freed, but ſaw themſelves in the quality of plain Tributaries to the <hi>Perſians. Iſdigunas</hi> alſo having gotten more wealth then ever Ambaſſador did, and received the higheſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours from the Emperour, together with immenſe gifts, was ſent home the richeſt man (I think) in <hi>Perſia.</hi> This only Ambaſſador had no Guard put upon him; himſelfe and his followers freely conferred, and kept company with whom they would; and in the city bought and ſold, and made any contracts, and were preſent at them, with all manner of licenſe, no <hi>Roman</hi> attending them to obſerve their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as was wont to be.</p>
               <p>At this time alſo wer <hi>Heats,</hi> ſuch as none ever remembred the like, the Roſes towards the winter growing in abundance, as in the ſpring, with no manner of difference, and the weather as hot as at midſummer: And the vintage being long paſt, new Grapes came up. Some divined from hence at great accidents likely to ſucceed; but the naturall cauſe of it was the continuance of the Southerly winds, longer then was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, from whence came thoſe unuſuall heats.

               <p>DUring the ſayd Negotiation at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> for a truce; in <hi>Lazica</hi> King <hi>Gubazes</hi> affected the <hi>Romans,</hi> becauſe he found <hi>Choſroes</hi> to plot his death; but the generality of the <hi>Lazians</hi> offended with the <hi>Romans</hi> oppreſſions; and diſcontented with their Commanders, did for the moſt part favour the <hi>Perſians,</hi> not for love of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Government, but to be rid of the other, of two ills chooſing that rather which they felt not. And <hi>Theophobius</hi> a cheife man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, treated with <hi>Mermeroes</hi> to deliver to him the Caſtle of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>chimerium,</hi> who animated him to the action with large hopes of being a Favorite of <hi>Choſroes,</hi> and naturalized a <hi>Perſian,</hi> and of getting great wealth and preferments. There were no Forces joyned of <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Lazians,</hi> and the <hi>Perſians</hi> viſited all the Townes at their pleaſure. The Emperialiſts lay concealed, ſome neer the <hi>Phaſis,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in <hi>Archeopolis,</hi> and other Fortreſſes; and King <hi>Gubazes</hi> lay quiet upon the tops of Mountaines: So that <hi>Theophobius</hi> without any difficulty appearing, came to the Caſtle and told the Emperiall Garriſon there, That the <hi>Roman</hi> Army was cut in peices, King <hi>Gubazes</hi> ruined, and <hi>Lazica</hi> wholly under the <hi>Perſians,</hi> without any hope of recovering the ſame for the <hi>Romans</hi> or <hi>Gubazes. Mermeroes</hi> with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty thouſand <hi>Perſians</hi> had done all this, and with great numbers of <hi>Sabirians;</hi> And that <hi>Choſroes</hi> was now alſo joyned ſuddenly with an innumerable Army, that all <hi>Lazica</hi> would ſcarce containe them. With this terrible newes <hi>Theophohius</hi> ſo frighted the Garriſon, that they beſought him even by the God of their Fathers to finde ſome accommodation for them. He promiſed to procure their ſafety from <hi>Choſroes;</hi> and returning immediately to <hi>Mermeroes,</hi> obtained of him ſome princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall <hi>Perſians</hi> with Commiſſion to repaire to <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>chimerium,</hi> and having given aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances to the Garriſon for their lives and Goods, to take poſſeſſion of the Caſtle; by the having whereof the <hi>Perſians</hi> were abſolute Maſters of <hi>Lazica.</hi> They ſubdued alſo <hi>Scymnia</hi> and <hi>Suania,</hi> that all places from <hi>Muchiriſis</hi> to <hi>Iberia</hi> were unacceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to the <hi>Romans</hi> and King <hi>Gubazes.</hi> And nor <hi>Romans</hi> nor <hi>Lazians</hi> durſt meddle with the Enemy, nor come, the one from their Fortreſſes, the other downe from the Mountaines. <hi>Mermeroes</hi> during the Winter, repaired with timber the Walls of <hi>Coitaeſis,</hi> and placed in it three thouſand <hi>Perſians;</hi> he put alſo a competent Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>chimerium,</hi> and repaired another Caſtle called <hi>Sarapalis,</hi> upon the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier of <hi>Lazica.</hi> Then he martcht toward the <hi>Phaſis,</hi> where he underſtood that the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Lazians</hi> had newly made head and were encamped. But <hi>Gubazes</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Commanders at the firſt news of his coming disbanded, and every man ſaved himſelfe as he could. <hi>Gubazes</hi> ran up againe to the Mountaines, and there with his Wife and Children made an end of the Winter, fighting it out with pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and the hard weather, and comforting himſelfe (as men uſe) with hopes from <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> And the other chiefe <hi>Lazians</hi> in their reſpect to their King were contented, as he, with hard winter lodgings in the holes of Rocks. Enemy they feared none in thoſe Mountaines, being (eſpecially in the Winter) not to be med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with; but famine and other miſery made them weary of their lives. <hi>Mermero<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In all things elſe he ruled the Countrey at his pleaſure, and to <hi>Gubazes</hi> wrote this Letter.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Power and wiſedome are the two compoſers of humane affaires; and they who in power excell others, live as they liſt, and bring the weaker to what termes they pleaſe, who being ſlaves to the ſtronger cure their want of power with wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and by ſoothing their Conquerours, hold that with comfort, whereof their infirmity deprives them. This is generally in all Nations, and is fixed in the nature of men. So that gentle <hi>Gubazes!</hi> if you thinke you can vanquiſh the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> delay not your owne good, but come to Battell, you ſhall finde us in what part of <hi>Lazica</hi> you pleaſe, ready to fight with you for the Countrey. With us you may now try your power, who can never thinke afterward to oppoſe the whole power of <hi>Perſia.</hi> Or you may take the ſecond courſe, which is to know
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:50471:144"/>your ſelfe, and to adore <hi>Choſroes</hi> as your Maſter, King, and Conquerour; by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications you may be rid of your preſent miſeries; I undertake that the King will be gracious to you, and will give you of the beſt Hoſtages in <hi>Perſia</hi> for the perpetuall aſſurance of your life and Kingdome. If neither of theſe pleaſe, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the <hi>Lazians,</hi> made miſerable by your bad counſels, to raiſe themſelves from the difficulties that preſſe them; and ſee them not cruſht with an endleſſe ruine, while you truſt to the ſlippery hopes of <hi>Roman</hi> Succours, who can vindicate you no more then hitherto they have done.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gubazes</hi> was not perſwaded by this Letter, but ſtill ſtayd upon the Mountaines; his hatred of <hi>Choſroes</hi> not ſuffering him to deſpaire in the <hi>Roman</hi> Succours. Mens judgements ever thus tune to that which pleaſes their wills, admitting all reaſons of that ſide, without examination of the ſoundneſſe of them; and obſtinately not crediting, nor weighing the arguments which croſſe their deſires.</p>
               <p>About this time certaine Monks came out of <hi>India,</hi> and getting acceſſe to the Emperour, promiſed to effect his long deſire, that the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould no more buy the <hi>Metaxa,</hi> or Raw-ſilke from the <hi>Perſians</hi> their Enemies, nor any other Nations. For having remained long in thoſe Countries, they had learnt the way how the ſame might be had in the <hi>Roman</hi> Provinces. They told him that certaine Wormes, taught by nature, did ſpin this Raw-ſilke; to bring the Wormes alive, that it was not poſſible, but eaſie to get their Bags, wherein were innumerable Eggs, which being covered in Dung, and thereby heated, produced the Wormes. The Emperour promiſed them a great reward to bring their undertaking to effect; who returned into <hi>India,</hi> brought thoſe Eggs to <hi>Conſtartinaple,</hi> and being by the meanes afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd growne to Wormes, fed them with Mulbery leaves, and ſo cauſed the making of Raw-ſilke in the <hi>Roman</hi> Territories.</p>
               <p>The Winter being ended, <hi>Iſdigunas</hi> came to <hi>Choſroes</hi> with the Money, and the Treaty agreed upon, who ſealed the ſame and took the Money; wherewith levying agreat Army of <hi>Hunnes,</hi> he ſent them to <hi>Mermeroes,</hi> reſolving not to quit <hi>Lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca. Mermeroes</hi> with theſe <hi>Hunnes</hi> and his <hi>Perſians</hi> and Elephants marcht againſt the Townes of <hi>Lazica,</hi> whom the <hi>Romans</hi> encountred not, but under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Martinus</hi> fortified themſelves about the mouth of the <hi>Phaſis;</hi> and lay quiet, in the company of King <hi>Gubazes. Mermeroes</hi> led the Army firſt againſt a Caſtle where he underſtood the Siſter of <hi>Gubazes</hi> to be; but the Garriſon; and the ſtrength of the place beat him from thence, and cauſed him to retyre without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any hurt in that journey either to <hi>Romans</hi> or <hi>Lazians.</hi> Marching into <hi>Abaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi> he found the narrow and rocky paſſage into the ſame poſſeſt by a <hi>Roman</hi> Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, who oppoſed his entrance. So that he drew back, and went againſt <hi>Archaec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis;</hi> and not prevailing there neither, he retyred with his Army: which the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> followed, and in that faſt Countrey intercepted many, and killed the cheif Commander of the <hi>Sabirian Hunnes.</hi> But fighting about the dead body, the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> forced away the Enemy, and retyred to <hi>Coitaiſis</hi> in <hi>Mucheiriſis.</hi> Such were the ſucceſſes of the Armies in <hi>Lazica.</hi>

               <p>IN <hi>Aſrica</hi> all things proceeded fairly for the <hi>Romans,</hi> by the incredible ſucceſſes of <hi>John</hi> the Generall, who had drawn to his party <hi>Cutzinas,</hi> a Prince of <hi>Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> then vanquiſht all the other <hi>Numidians</hi> in a battell, and ſoon after brought <hi>Antalas</hi> and <hi>Jabdas,</hi> (who were Princes of Moores in <hi>Byzacium</hi> and <hi>Numidia</hi>) to follow him in the quality of ſlaves.

               <p>In the mean time in <hi>Europe,</hi> the <hi>Gepades,</hi> who (as I ſaid formerly) made a truce with the <hi>Lombards,</hi> not ending their differences, reſolved upon a war again, which grew as hot as ever: The <hi>Gepades</hi> being led by <hi>Thoriſin,</hi> and the <hi>Lombards</hi> by <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auin;</hi> followed by great multitudes on both ſides. They came neer, but the armies diſcerned not one another; when a ſudden Panick fear, without any cauſe appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, frighted both the armies ſo, that they ran away, leaving their Commanders
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:50471:145"/>with ſome few only behind: who neither with fair words nor threates could ſtopp them. <hi>Auduin</hi> not knowing the Enemy was in the ſame caſe, ſent an Embaſſage to the Enemy for truce. The Ambaſſadors, finding the <hi>Gepades</hi> to have had the ſame for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune <q>with themſelves, demanded of <hi>Thoriſin,</hi> whether his people were gone; they are fled (quoth <hi>Thoriſin</hi>) none purſuing, and ſo are the <hi>Lombards,</hi> ſayd they: ſince you deal truly with us, we will conceal nothing from you. And ſince God is pleaſed that theſe nations ſhal not periſh, and hath caſt on us both this ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fear, let us concur with that gracious ſentence, and make an end of the war.</q> Be it ſo, quoth <hi>Thoriſin,</hi> and ſo a Ceſſation was concluded for two years, and in the mean time to ſend their Heralds, mutually and fully to compoſe the differences: but not being able to end the ſame, they fell again to the way of hoſtility. The <hi>Gepados</hi> feared that the <hi>Romans</hi> would joyne with the <hi>Lombards,</hi> and therefore they ſent to the <hi>Cuturgurians, Hunnes</hi> inhabiting on this ſide the Lake of <hi>Maeotis,</hi> to aſſiſt them in this war againſt the <hi>Lombards.</hi> They ſent them twelve thouſand men, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>Chinialus,</hi> an experienced Souldier. But one year of the Ceſſation being yet to come, and the <hi>Gepaedes</hi> having no occaſion to uſe ſuch a multitude, perſwaded them in the interim, as upon the by, to invade the <hi>Romans,</hi> who keeping no exact Guards upon the <hi>Iſter,</hi> into <hi>Illyrium</hi> and <hi>Thrace,</hi> the <hi>Gepaedes</hi> tranſported the <hi>Hunnes</hi> into the Empire; who ſpoiled the country, and ſackt the Towns.

The <hi>Vtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurians</hi> upon this remonſtrance of the Emperour, and of the many preſents they had received from him, and upon receit of more mony now, were won to invade the <hi>Cuturgurians</hi> country.

               <p>IN theſe times was a great Warr between the <hi>Varnians</hi> and the Iſlanders of <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia:</hi> The <hi>Varnians</hi> are ſeated beyond the River <hi>Iſler,</hi> and extend to the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Ocean, and the <hi>Rhyne,</hi> which River divides them, and the <hi>Francks,</hi> and the other Nations inhabiting thoſe parts.

I hold it more advantagious for you, to have allyance with the <hi>Francks</hi> then with the <hi>Brittians;</hi> who being Iſlanders, cannot joyne with you in time, nor eaſily: whereas nothing ſevers the <hi>Francks,</hi> but the <hi>Rhyne,</hi> from you. And being ſo neer and ſo powerfull, they are at hand both to helpe and hurt you; and hurt they will, if this allyance reſtraine them not: An over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>growne
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:50471:146"/>neighbour proves heavy, and apt to doe wrong, and the meanes of a War are eaſie againſt men at the next doore. Quit therefore that betroathed Iſlander, and the Money ſhee hath received reſtore, according to the Law of Nations, for a reparation of the refuſall of her: and let my Son <hi>Radiſis</hi> marry his Mother-in-law, which our Lawes permit.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hermegiſclus</hi> gave this adviſe, and at the fortieth day dyed; and his Son taking the Kingdome, renounced his betroathed Spouſe by the perſwaſion of his Nobles, and tooke his Mother-in-law to Wife. The contracted Lady could not brook the ſcorne done her, but was eager to revenge it. For ſo tender of their honour are the <hi>Barbarians</hi> of thoſe parts, that after the name onely of a marriage without conſummation, if the woman be refuſed, ſhee thinks her ſelfe profeſt a Strumpet. Firſt ſhee ſent Meſſengers to demand the reaſon of this rejection, ſeeing he could not charge her with incontinence, nor any other offence; but that way prevailing nothing, with a manly courage ſhee reſolved upon a Warr: Shee got four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Ships and an hundred thouſand men, whom her ſelfe led, with one of her Brothers to aſſiſt her. The <hi>Brittians</hi> are the braveſt Infantry we know, but ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exerciſed in Horſemanſhip, that they know not what a Horſe is, nor ever ſaw in <hi>Brittia</hi> the Picture of any, where never any was bred.</p>
               <p>When upon Ambaſſages they come abroad among the <hi>Romans,</hi> or <hi>Francks,</hi> and are put to neceſſity of riding, men lift them up, and ſet them upon their Horſes; and ſo take them downe againe when they are to alight. The <hi>Varaians</hi> alſo are all Footmen. Aboard the aforeſayd Fleet were none but rowers, for the <hi>Brittians</hi> have no Sailes: Being landed upon the Continent, the Virgin-Generall encamped at the mouth of the <hi>Rhyne,</hi> where ſtaying her ſelfe, ſhee ſent out her Brother a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Enemy: He finding the <hi>Varnians</hi> neer the Sea ſhore encamped, had a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell with them and defeated them, where many fell, and the reſt with their King fled, and were followed by the <hi>Angles</hi> as farr as foot-men could; who retyring to the Campe, were by the Lady chid, and eſpecially her Brother, for having nothing worthy ſuch an Army, ſeeing he brought not <hi>Radiſis</hi> to her alive. Shee ſelected then her beſt men, and charged them to bring the man to her: who in the end found him concealed in a Wood, and brought him bound to the Lady. He ſtood before her trembling, expecting ſome cruell death: But ſhee onely reproaching to him the unjuſt affront he had done her, askt him why he would neglect his Vow, and bed another Woman, his owne Spouſe not having committed whoredome. He excuſed all upon the injunctions of a Father, and the importunity of his Nobles, mingling his apologie with ſupplications, and imputing the crime to neceſſity, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing now, if it were her pleaſure, to live with her, and by his future ſervices to cure his former injury. The Lady was pleaſed, and <hi>Radiſis</hi> looſed from his bonds was vouchſafed all manner of courteſie: And immediately he ſent home the Siſter of <hi>Theodebert,</hi> and marryed this <hi>Brittian</hi> Lady,</p>
               <p>In <hi>Brittia</hi> alſo is a Wall dividing a great part of the Iſland in two; the reaſon of it is, becauſe to the Eaſtward is good ayre according to the ſeaſons, and many ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Inhabitants, and they have Corne and Fruit-trees in abundance, and are well ſtored with waters. But to the Weſtward all is ſo contrary, that a man cannot live there halfe an houre, the Countrey being poſſeſt with Adders and Snakes, and all ſorts of venemous creatures. The natives affirme, that ſo ſoon as a man paſſes to the other ſide of the Wall, he inſtantly falls dead with the peſtilentiall ayre; and the like happens to Beaſts.</p>
               <p>In this deſcription I am to mention a Story, or rather a Fable; I cannot think it true, though many men affirme to have ſeen it and been actors in it, neither muſt I abſolutely reject it, leaſt profeſſing to write of the particularities of this Iſland, I be thought ignorant of the things done in it. They report that to this part of the Iſland are tranſported the Soules of the departed, by a meanes, which though I have heard in very good earneſt related, yet I conceive that the firſt rumour of it ſprung from ſome dreaming heads. Along the Ocean ſhore, over againſt <hi>Brittia,</hi> are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Villages, inhabited by Fiſhermen, Husbandmen, and Boatmen, who traffique in the Iſland; ſubjects they are to the <hi>Francks,</hi> but pay no Tribute, the exemption from which is granted unto them for a ſervice which I will now relate. They have the employment of conducting Soules departed impoſed on them by turnes; when
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:50471:146"/>any mans turne comes, they goe home to bed towards night, expecting their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low conductor; and at midnight they finde the door opened, and heare a ſoftly voice calling them to the buſineſſe: Inſtantly they riſe, and go downe to the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, finding themſelves conſtrained to goe on, but they perceive not by whom: Boats they finde ready, with no men in them, and aboard they goe and ſit to their Oares. They perceive the Boats loaded with Paſſengers even to the Deck; and the place of their Oares not an inch from the water: They ſee nothing, but after an houres rowing, come a Land in <hi>Brittia,</hi> whereas in their owne Boats they have much adoe to paſſe over in a day and a night, having no Sayles, but rowing onely. They inſtantly land their Fare, and are gone away with their Boats ſuddenly grown light, and ſwimming with the current, and having all ſave the Keele above water: They ſee no men leaveing the Boat, but they heare a voice, relating to ſome, who it ſeemes ſtayes there for them, the names of the Paſſengers, with their Titles, and additions of what Fathers they were; and (if women) of what Husbands.

The reaſon of this determination of the Emperour was not knowne; for who can declare the counſels of his heart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his conſent? But men did conjecture that his Majeſty did conſider how the reſt of the Commanders would grudge to have their power leſſened, and to be made ſubordinate to <hi>John;</hi> whereupon either by contrary opinions, or through envy, they might purpoſely prejudice his affaires. I heard alſo this ſtory at my former be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Rome</hi> from one of the <hi>Senators,</hi> That in the Raigne of <hi>Atalaricus,</hi> a heard of Cattell about evening came into <hi>Rome,</hi> and paſt through the Market place, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Forum pacis,</hi> where ſtood the ancient Temple of peace, and was thunder-ſtruck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en. Over againſt this Market place ſtands an ancient Conduit, and upon it a bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Bullock, the work of <hi>Phidias</hi> the <hi>Athenian,</hi> or of <hi>Lyſippus;</hi> there being in the ſame place many Statues of their making, and upon one the name of <hi>Phidias</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven. There is here alſo the Bullock made by <hi>Myron:</hi> The ancient <hi>Romans</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt ſtudious to make all the faireſt peices of <hi>Greece</hi> the ornaments of <hi>Rome.</hi> But the Senator told me, that an Oxe of this Heard was left behinde the reſt, and got up to the Conduit, and ſtood above by the brazen Bullock; and that a <hi>Tulcan</hi> paſſing by, a plaine countrey fellow in appearance, but a pretended <hi>Soothſayer</hi> (as all the <hi>Tuſcan</hi> are) ſayd, That one day an <hi>Eunuch</hi> ſhould depoſe the Prince of <hi>Rome.</hi> The <hi>Tuſcan</hi> and his Divination was then laught at, as all predictions are, before they be juſtified by the event, ſeeming till then ridiculous and fabulous: But now all men admire that his interpretation, being convinced by the event. So that <hi>Narſes</hi> was choſen Generall againſt <hi>Totilas,</hi> either the Emperour wiſely foreſeeing the ſucceſſe, or fortune determining the ſame: And <hi>Narſes</hi> with a Gallant Army, and ſtore of Treaſure was diſpatcht.

He had burnt the moſt part of it, eſpecially beyond the <hi>Tiber;</hi> and theſe men being grown little better then Slaves, and ſtript of all they had, were ſo unable to vindicate the publick, that they could not get every man his ownpeculiar right: and yet are the <hi>Romans</hi> the beſt patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots in the world, ſtudying to recover from all parts, what belongs to their City, and to ſave all the ancient Ornaments of <hi>Rome</hi> from periſhing. During ſo long a ſubjection to <hi>Barbarians,</hi> how did they preſerve their publick buildings and ornaments of their City! Even the orginall monuments of their race do yet laſt, the ſufficiency of thoſe ancient workmen holding out againſt the ruines of time, and the negligence of men Among which there yet ſtands a miraculous ſpectacle, which my ſelfe have ſeen; the ſhip of <hi>Aenaeas</hi> the founder of their City: it is for one row of oares only, and of a huge length, being 120 foot long, and 25. broad. It is ſo high only, as that men may row in it. The Timbers in it are not morteſſed into one another, nor faſtned by iron; but are every one of a peice, ſuch as were never heard of, and are only found in this ſhip, that we can learn. For the keele be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all one peice, reaches from the ſtern to the foreſhip, and bowes by little and little into a convenient crookedneſſe, then ſtrangely turnes ſtraight again, and moſt aptly in proportion. The ribs alſo of the ſhip reach from ſide to ſide, crooking downwards, and bowing ſo handſomely, that one would think the hollow bulk of the Ship to be made round and turned with inſtruments; either nature providing ſuch a crookedneſſe in the Timber for the preſent uſe, or elſe thoſe uneven ribs were fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by mens hands, or Engins. Every planck alſo reaches from the ſtern to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, being all of a peice, and have only ſpikes of iron to faſten them to the ſhipps ribs, and to make up her ſides. Thus doth this ſhip affoard a ſight beyond expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; ſtrange workman-ſhips naturally riſing above diſcourſe, and as they ſubdue common things by thenew invention, ſo over-maſtring evenſpeech it ſelfe. And the ſhip is ſtrong and luſty yet, and ſound all through, none of the Timbers having any rottenneſſe appearing; as if the ſhip-wright (whatſoever he were) had lately built it.</p>

               <p>THE <hi>Goths</hi> with their fleet came to <hi>Corcyra,</hi> and forraged the Iſland, and the Ilands alſo of <hi>Syntae.</hi> They landed alſo upon the main land of <hi>Epirus,</hi> and pillaged the townes about <hi>Dodona</hi> and <hi>Nicopolis</hi> it ſelfe, and <hi>Anchia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> where <hi>Anchiſes,</hi> the Father of <hi>Aenaeas</hi> ſayling from <hi>Troy</hi> dyed, and gave the name to the Towne. They tooke upon the coaſt alſo many Greeke ſhippes, and ſome tranſporting Proviſions to <hi>Narſes</hi> Army. <hi>Totilas</hi> likewiſe ſent an army into <hi>Picenia</hi> to take <hi>Ancona,</hi> commanded by <hi>Skipuar,</hi> and <hi>Giblas</hi> and <hi>Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulſe,</hi> (called by ſome <hi>Indulfe</hi>) formerly of the life-guard to <hi>Beliſarius.</hi> He gave them forty ſeven gallies to block up the Caſtle by ſea alſo. The Seige laſting long, and the beſieged wanting victuall, <hi>Valerianus</hi> being at <hi>Ravenna,</hi> and unable alone to ſuccour it, wrote this Letter to <hi>John, Vitalianus</hi> his Siſters Son, at <hi>Salonae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Ancona</hi> you know is only left us within the <hi>Jonian</hi> Gulfe, if it be left us: it is ſo ſharply beſieged, that I fear our ſuccours will come too late, and we ſhall uſe our indeavour after our opportunity. I forbear to write more; the neceſſity of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged claimes all our time, and their danger permits not a long Epiſtle, requiring ſuccour ſwifter then ſpeech.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John,</hi> though the Emperour had forbidden him to ſtir, adventured to go, concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the neceſſity, whereinto fortune had caſt them, to diſpence with the Emperours inſtructions: He choſe his beſt ſouldiers, and put them aboard forty Gallies, ſwift of Sail, and well built for a Sea fight; and having furniſhed them with all neceſſaries, came with them before <hi>Ancona.</hi> Whether ſoon after came <hi>Valerianus</hi> with twelve ſhips: Upon conference together they roſe from thence, and Anchor'd at a place called <hi>Senogallia,</hi> not far from <hi>Ancona.</hi> The <hi>Goths</hi> Generall alſo manned forty ſeven ſhips with their choice men, leaving the reſt to block up the Caſtle: and ſailed againſt the <hi>Romans. Skipuar</hi> commanded the men left behinde, and <hi>Giblas</hi> and <hi>Gundulfe</hi> thoſe in the Ships. The Fleets being neer, each drew their ſhips as cloſe together as might be and exhorted their men. <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Valerianus</hi> ſpake thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Think not fellow Souldiers! that you are to fight now only for the Caſtle of <hi>Ancona,</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> in it; but that the main of the war depends upon this bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell; and that the concluſion of our fortune is to be drawn in the ſame Lot with it. Conſider, how the cheif moment of war conſiſts in the expences of it, and that they who want ſupplies, are of neceſſity to be beaten in the End. Valour and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger cannot dwell long together, nature not induring to pine with famine, and to fight bravely too: And other fortreſſe we have none between <hi>Otranto</hi> and <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venna,</hi> where we can lay in any proviſions for our ſelves or our Horſes. And the Enemy being Maſter of the Country we have no place our freind, from whence to furniſh any ſmall proportion of victuall. In <hi>Ancona</hi> is our only hope,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:50471:148"/>where ſuch as come from the oppoſite land may put in and ride ſafely. So that if we win this battell, and thereby aſſure <hi>Ancona,</hi> we may hope well of all the reſt of this war; but if we be defeated, I will not ſpeak any thing that is harſh, God grant unto the <hi>Romans</hi> the perpetuall Dominion of <hi>Italy.</hi> And conſider too, that if you ſpeed ill now, you cannot ſo much as run away; the Enemy poſſeſſing all the land, and being alſo abſolute maſter of the Sea. Our only hope of living now is in our armes, and depends upon our actions in this fight. Fight bravely therefore, having this in your minds, that if you now be beaten, it will be your laſt beating; if you conquer, you will be rancked with honour among the moſt happy.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Valerianus;</hi> and the Goths Commander ſpake thus. <q>Theſe wretched men expulſed out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and long hid in ſome corners of the Sea and Land, ſeeing now they dare to ſight with us again; it is our parts to check their unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed preſumption, leaſt it grow higher being let alone. Folly, not reſtrained in the beginning, proceeds to endleſſe daring, and at laſt ruines thoſe it incounters. Shew them then quickly, that they are Greeks, and naturally cowards, and now grown deſperate with being beaten. Take heed leaſt they proſper upon this Experiment; Cowardize deſpiſed, becomes bold, and fool-hardineſſe in the end may grow to be incapable of fear. And if you do valiantly, thinke not that they can ſtand long. A ſpirit not meaſured out proportionably to the power of him that uſes it, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly riſes before the buſineſſe; but when the battell is begun, it ſuckes. Remember therefore the often tryals this Enemy hath made of your valour;</q> &amp; from their then ſucceſſe, argue, that they are not now ſuddenly become better men; but have raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly undertaken as then, and will go off with the like fortune.</p>
               <p>After theſe exhortations, the battell began, and was ſtoutly ſought, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like a land fight. They ſtood with all their ſhips in front againſt each other; and plied their Bowes. The forwardeſt grapled, and fought from the decks with Javelin and ſword, as in a feild. But the <hi>Goths</hi> unexperienced in Sea-ſights maintained the incounter with much diſorder. Some ſtood aloofe, whereby the <hi>Romans</hi> ſet on them ſingle: Some came on ſo thick, that they fell, foule with their fellowes for want of Roome. Their ſhips ſtood jumbled together like ſo many baskets that they could neither ſhoot at the Enemy, nor manage their Javelins nor ſwords; but were perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually imployed in getting cleer of one another, with loud clamours, and confuſed puſhing off with their long poles; intangling their front for want of roome, and then getting aloofe, and both to their own miſcheiſe: their cries and hollowings were not againſt the Enemy, but to their own men to keep off; and thus puzzelling one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they were the cheifeſt cauſe of the Enemies victory. Who in their cloſe fights did valiantly, and in their Sea fights skillfully; keeping their ſhips in front, not too far aſunder, nor more cloſe then was convenient; And ſtill joyning and ſevering in good proportion, when they ſaw an Enemies ſhip ſcatter'd, they ſtruck at her, and with eaſe ſunck her; and where they ſaw the Enemy in confusion, thither they ſent clouds of arrowes; then ſeeing them wearied with the toyle of their diſorder, they fell on them and cut them in peices. The <hi>Goths</hi> deſponding, did neither conſider their croſſe fortune, nor their own Errours; and being not able either to uſe their ſhips, nor to fight from their decks they left fighting and fell to a dangerous quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, committing themſelves to fortune; and then betook themſelves to a ſhameful and diſorderly retreat, having no remembrance either of reſiſting, or of handeſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flying; but being ſcattered among their Enemies, they ſtood amazed. Eleven ſhips got away; the reſt the <hi>Romans</hi> took, or ſunck with the men in them. <hi>Giblas</hi> was taken Priſoner; but <hi>Gundulſe</hi> eſcaped in the eleven ſhips, and the men being landed, he ſet them on fire, that they might not come into the Enemies hands. Then they went a foot to <hi>Ancona,</hi> where relating the accident to their companions, they all retired from thence, leaving their camp for the <hi>Romans,</hi> and they ran tumultuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into <hi>Auximum.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> came to the <hi>Goths</hi> camp before <hi>Ancona,</hi> and took it, then put proviſions into the Caſtle, and ſailed away, <hi>Valerianus</hi> to <hi>Ravenna,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> to <hi>Salonae.</hi> This overthrow much abated the power of <hi>Totilas.</hi>

The <hi>Goths</hi> were terrified therewith, and with
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:50471:148"/>the late defeat at Sea, and their hearts with theſe loſſes were ſo dejected, that if any ſuccours ſhould come to the <hi>Romans,</hi> they had no thought of ſubſiſting, or of keeping their footing in <hi>Italy;</hi> nor could they hope to obtain any thing from the Emperour. For <hi>Totilas</hi> had ſent many Ambaſſadours to the Emperour, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how the <hi>Francks</hi> had ſeiſed upon a great ſhare of <hi>Italy,</hi> and how the reſt was become waſt: That the <hi>Goths</hi> ſhould quit to him <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> which only remained unſpoyled; and ſhould pay tribute for the waſted Lands in <hi>Italy,</hi> and ſerve the Emperour againſt all the World, and in other things be obedient to him. But the Emperour would take no notice of theſe overtures, but ſtill ſent away the Ambaſſadours, being diſtaſted at the very name of <hi>Goths,</hi> and purpoſing to chaſe them out of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.</p>

               <p>NOT long before dyed <hi>Theodebert</hi> King of the <hi>Francks,</hi> having unjuſtly made tributary ſome Townes in <hi>Liguria,</hi> and the <hi>Cottian Alpes,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Venetia:</hi> The <hi>Francks</hi> thus getting without blowes, what the two <hi>Antagoniſts</hi> were buſily fighting for. In <hi>Venetia</hi> the <hi>Goths</hi> had little; the Sea-townes the <hi>Romans</hi> had, and the <hi>Francks</hi> ſeiſed upon the reſt, while neither the <hi>Goths</hi> nor <hi>Romans</hi> had leiſure to make new Enemies. The <hi>Goths</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo came to this agreement with the <hi>Francks;</hi> that during the War with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, <q>both ſhould hold what they had, and forbeare hoſtility. If <hi>Totilas</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, that then the ſaid acquiſitions of the <hi>Francks</hi> be diſpoſed, as ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed between the parties.</q> But in the Kingdome of <hi>Theodebert</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Theu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibald</hi> his Son, to whom the Emperour ſent <hi>Leontius</hi> a Senator, and Son-in-law to <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> his Ambaſſadour, to perſwade a League againſt <hi>Totilas,</hi> and to demand the Townes in <hi>Italy,</hi> unjuſtly held by <hi>Theodebert,</hi> and ſurpriſed during the Truce. The Ambaſſadour ſpake thus to <hi>Theudibald.</hi> 
                  <q>Others, Sir, (it may be) have had Accidents which they expected not, but no men (I think) ſuch as the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> have had from you. The Emperour entred not into this VVar, nay not into any expoſtulation with the <hi>Goths,</hi> before the <hi>Francks</hi> had received great ſums of money of him, and had promiſed aides, and the conjunction of their Forces: VVhich Accord they have not only not performed, but have done us injuries, which none could imagine. Your Father <hi>Theodebert</hi> hath intruded into a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince by the Emperour, acquired with much toile and hazard, and with the <hi>Francks</hi> conſent. But I come not to chide, nor complain, but to demand only, and therewithall to give you this adviſe; to eſtabliſh the proſperity you have, and to let the <hi>Romans</hi> have that which is theirs. Some ſmall thing often times unjuſtly gotten, is the occaſion of loſing greate and powerfull acquiſitions; ſtable hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, and injuſtice never meeting in one point. I adviſe you likewiſe to joyn in this War, according to your Fathers engagement to the Emperour. Nothing becomes good Sonnes better, then to rectifie their Fathers erroneous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and to ratifie what they have well done.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The wiſh of a wiſe man is, that his Son may emulate his vertuous Actions, and if he have done any thing amiſſe, he wiſhes another may rather imitate it, then his Son. Indeed you ſhould not have needed invitation to this War againſt the <hi>Goths,</hi> originally your Enemies, and falſe to you of old, and ever in War with you, without truce or quarter. Now for feare of us they fawn upon you, but being rid of us, they will ſoon ſhew their intentions. Wicked men change not their Natures with their Fortunes; in adverſities indeed they hide them, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when they have need of a Neighbour. Conſider this, and renew your Amity with the Emperour, and take a revenge againſt your ancient Enemies.</q> 
                  <hi>Theudibald</hi> anſwered this Speech in this manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>It is not now juſt in you, to demand our aſſiſtance againſt the <hi>Goths,</hi> now in Amity with us; If we prove unſure to them, we ſhall not be truſty to you. A bad diſpoſition to Friends being once diſcovered, puts a man for feare out of the right way. Concerning the Townes you mention, my Father <hi>Theodebert</hi> was no
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:50471:149"/>oppreſſour of his Neighbours, nor intruder: And it appeares ſo, for I am not rich; And he took not the Townes from the Emperour, but got them fairely from <hi>Totilas,</hi> the then owner of them, which ſhould pleaſe the Emperour, to ſee one who wronged him, diſſeiſed by another, and thereby juſtly puniſhed, unleſſe becauſe he would have them himſelfe, and cannot get them, he will envie him that can. But let us refer the examination of theſe things to Arbitrators: If it ſhall appeare that my Father hath taken any thing unjuſtly from the <hi>Romans,</hi> there is reaſon we ſhould give ſatisfaction:</q> And we will ſhortly ſend our Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> touching the ſame. With this he diſmiſſed <hi>Leontius,</hi> and ſent <hi>Leudard</hi> a <hi>Franck</hi> his Ambaſſadour to <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> with three others; who at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> effected what they came about.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Totilas</hi> deſired to get the Iſlands belonging to <hi>Africk,</hi> and he ſent an Army to <hi>Corſica,</hi> and <hi>Sardinia,</hi> which he made tributary to him. <hi>John</hi> the Generall of <hi>Africk,</hi> ſent preſently to <hi>Sardinia</hi> ſome Forces, who beſieged the City of <hi>Carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis;</hi> blocking it up only but not able to aſſault it, having a very ſufficient Garriſon of <hi>Goths</hi> within, which ſallied ſuddenly, and routed the <hi>Romans;</hi> who having loſt many, ran to their Ships, and returned to <hi>Carthage,</hi> where they wintered, purpoſing in the Spring to renew the Voyage with greater preparations. There growes an Herb in this Iſland of <hi>Sardinia,</hi> which being taſted, puts men into fatall Convulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wherein they ſeem to laugh, and quickly dye of it; whence is called the <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donian</hi> laughter. <hi>Corſica</hi> was anciently named <hi>Cyrnus,</hi> and in it, as there is a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Dwarfes, ſo there are races of horſes not much bigger then ſheep.</p>
               <p>A mighty troup at that time of <hi>Slavonians,</hi> fel upon <hi>Illyrium,</hi> committing miſcheifs not to be expreſt. <hi>Juſtinian</hi> ſent againſt them an army commanded by the Sonnes of <hi>Germanus,</hi> and others. Who being much fewer then the Enemy, durſt not fight; but infeſted their Reare, and cut off ſome, &amp; ſent of them ſome priſoners to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour. Theſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> did infinite hurt, long pillaging the Country, and ſtrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the high wayes with dead bodies, and then went home with innumerable priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and all their booty, none incountring them. The <hi>Romans</hi> could not infeſt them in their paſſage over the <hi>Iſter,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Gaepedes</hi> tranſported them, and had for every head a gold ſtater for their fare: This troubled the Emperour, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no means to reſtrain their paſſage over the River <hi>Iſter,</hi> to ſpoile the Empire, nor their ſudden retreat, which made him reſolve to make a League with the <hi>Gaepedes</hi> who were then again quarrelling with the <hi>Lombards,</hi> and fearing the power of the <hi>Romans.</hi> (who had lately ſworn a league with the <hi>Lombards</hi>) they endeavoured to be admitted freinds and Auxiliaries. They ſent Ambaſſadors accordingly, and the Emperour ſwore a league with them alſo, and upon the demand of the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, twelve Senatots ſware it likewiſe. Shortly after, the Emperour ſent an army to aide the <hi>Lombards</hi> againſt the <hi>Gaepedes,</hi> whom he charged ſince the League, to have tranſported <hi>Slavonians</hi> over the River <hi>Iſter</hi> againſt the <hi>Romans.</hi> The Army was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by <hi>Iuſtine</hi> &amp; <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> the Sons of <hi>Germanus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Aratius</hi> and <hi>Swartwall,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly made Prince of the <hi>Herulians</hi> by the Emperor, but baniſhed (as I ſaid before) by the <hi>Herulians</hi> of <hi>Thule,</hi> and returning to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> made Generall of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts</hi> there. There was likewiſe <hi>Amalafridas</hi> a <hi>Goth,</hi> the Daughters Son of <hi>Amala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fridas</hi> (who was Siſter to <hi>Theoderick</hi>) by <hi>Hermenifrid</hi> Prince of the <hi>Thuringians,</hi> who being brought to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> by <hi>Beliſarius</hi> with <hi>Vitigis,</hi> the Emperour made him Commander of <hi>Roman</hi> troops, and betrothed his Siſter to <hi>Auduin</hi> Prince of the <hi>Lombards.</hi> Of the aforeſaid army only, that <hi>Amalafridas</hi> with his troops, came to the <hi>Lombards,</hi> the reſt by the Emperours direction ſtaid about the City of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lpiana,</hi> in <hi>Illyrium,</hi> where was a mutiny among the inhabitants about things, wherein Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians contend among themſelves, as ſhall be ſet down in my relations concerning the ſame. The <hi>Lombards</hi> with <hi>Amalafridas</hi> invaded the <hi>Gaepedes,</hi> and in a battell de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated them, and killed many: And <hi>Auduin</hi> their King ſent the good newes to the Emperour of his victory; but complained of the not coming up of the Emperours army according to the League; ſo great numbers of <hi>Lombards</hi> having been ſo lately ſent by him to aid <hi>Narſes</hi> againſt <hi>Totilas.</hi>

Then with much ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity he made up gallant companies out of the <hi>Conſtantinopolitan</hi> Guards, and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons of <hi>Thrace,,</hi> and many he raiſed in <hi>Illyrium.</hi> With him went <hi>John</hi> with his own Troops, and thoſe left him by <hi>Germanus</hi> his Father in Law. <hi>Auduin</hi> alſo, prince of the <hi>Lombards,</hi> in accompliſhment of the league, and for great ſummes given him by the Emperour, ſent five and twenty hundred ſelected men for auxlliaries, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a retinue of above three thouſand men. <hi>Narſes</hi> had alſo three thouſand <hi>Herulians,</hi> all horſemen, commanded by <hi>Philimuth</hi> and others, and he had many <hi>Hunnes. Dagiſtthaeus</hi> alſo was with him with his troops, being diſcharged of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment for the ſame purpoſe. <hi>Cabades</hi> went alſo with many Perſian fugitives, who was the Son of <hi>Zames,</hi> and Grand-child of King <hi>Cabades,</hi> and long ago came into the Empire; having by the practice of <hi>Chanaranges</hi> eſcaped his uncle <hi>Choſroes;</hi> and a young <hi>Gepaede</hi> very valiant, named <hi>Aſbadas,</hi> with four hundred <hi>Gepaedes,</hi> good Souldiers. And <hi>Aruth</hi> an <hi>Herulian,</hi> from a child bred among the Romans, and married to the widow of <hi>Mauricius</hi> the Son of <hi>Mundus,</hi> a gallant man, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with many old Souldiers of his Nation; <hi>Iohn Phagas</hi> alſo commanding many Romans, good Souldiers. <hi>Narſes</hi> was a man liberall, and moſt forward in releiving men in want; uſing his diſpoſition the more eaſily, by reaſon of his great power with
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:50471:150"/>the Emperour, ſo that he had obliged many, both commanders and common Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; who all upon his being now Generall were eager to ſerve under him, both in acknowledgement of former favours, and in expectation of great advancements by him. Above all, the <hi>Herulians,</hi> and other <hi>Barbarians</hi> loved him, having done them many benefits. Being come upon the Confines of <hi>Venetia,</hi> he ſent to the Captaines of the <hi>Francks,</hi> to demand paſſage as for freinds. They refuſed it, and proteſted to hinder it, both for the <hi>Francks</hi> good, and for their amity with the <hi>Goths,</hi> preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding alſo a poor excuſe; becauſe <hi>Narſes</hi> had with him <hi>Lombards,</hi> their greateſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. <hi>Narſes</hi> was troubled at it; but was told by ſome <hi>Italians,</hi> that if the <hi>Francks</hi> gave him paſſage, he could not from thence get to <hi>Ravenna,</hi> nor further poſſibly then to <hi>Verona.</hi> For <hi>Totilas</hi> had placed in <hi>Verona</hi> a choice number of <hi>Goths</hi> under <hi>Teias,</hi> a moſt valiant Generall, to lye in the <hi>Romans</hi> way. This <hi>Tejas</hi> had ſtopt up all the paſſages with workes, and made in ſome places with much art and labour thickets, in others, ditches, deep holes, and bogs, and overflowed the Grounds; and himſelf lay with his army ready to fight with the <hi>Roman</hi> army attempting to force their way. This was done by <hi>Totilas</hi> direction, knowing how the <hi>Romans</hi> would not be able to paſſe along the Sea-coaſt, by ſo many great Rivers mouths, which made the ſhore unpaſſable; and how they had not ſhips enough to tranſport the whole army at once over the Gulfe, and coming but few at once, that he might eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hinder their landing. <hi>Narſes</hi> being herewith much perplexed, <hi>John,</hi> who knew thoſe parts exactly, adviſed him to march with the army by the Sea-ſhore, the people there being their ſubjects; and to be attended with ſome ſhips, and many boats, with which boats they might make a bridge over the currents of thoſe rivers, and ſo make their paſſages: <hi>Narſes</hi> followed this adviſe, and got to <hi>Ravenna</hi> with his whole ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>

               <p>DUring the wars, came to <hi>Conſtantinople Ildigiſall,</hi> a <hi>Lombard.</hi> The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the <hi>Lombards</hi> of right belonged to him, but <hi>Anduin</hi> forced it from him, whereupon he fled his country. <hi>Juſtinian</hi> entertained him with favour, &amp; made him Captaine of one of the Cohorts, called <hi>Scholae,</hi> which guard the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace. He had three hundred followers his country men, who had been bred ſometime with him in <hi>Thrace.

This <hi>Ildigiſall</hi> afterward grew diſcontented at the meanneſs of his entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; which <hi>Goar</hi> perceived, a <hi>Goth,</hi> taken in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> in the warrs of <hi>Vitigis,</hi> and ſent Priſoner to <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> being a man proud and valiant, and repining at his condition, and upon the late revolt of the <hi>Goths</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> he was diſcovered to plot againſt the Roman State. This <hi>Goar</hi> perſwaded <hi>Ildigiſall</hi> to run from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> promiſing to accompany him; and ſo with ſome few with them they came to <hi>Apri,</hi> a City in <hi>Thrace,</hi> joyned with ſome <hi>Lombards</hi> they found there, and taking many Horſes from the Emperours Horſe-paſtures in <hi>Thrace,</hi> they went forward. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour commanded the Companies in <hi>Thrace</hi> and <hi>Illyrium</hi> to oppoſe theſe Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.

In <hi>Illyrium</hi> they found an Army levyed againſt them, commanded by <hi>Aratius, Recithangus, Leonianus, Arimuth,</hi> and others: Who having rode all day, reſolved in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to lodge in a woody ground, and taking with them each three or four Souldiers, went to drinke of the River, being extreamly thirſty. <hi>Ildigiſall</hi> and <hi>Goar,</hi> underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of their being there by their Scouts, ſell ſuddenly upon them, and killed them all; and thenceforward marcht on at their eaſe, the Souldiers perplexed, and without Commanders ryding back againe.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>After you had filled the World with rumours, and poſſeſt</hi> Italy <hi>with phantaſmes, thinking to ſcare away the</hi> Goths <hi>with your bigg looks; now you have encloſed your ſelves in</hi> Ravenna, <hi>that an Enemy may not ſee your faint hearts, which you cover with the ſame brave countenance, and lye with your mingled multitude of</hi> Barbarians <hi>upon a Countrey, wherein you have no right: For ſhame riſe from thence and fight, ſhew your ſelves; keep us not thus under a tedious expectation: We attend you like ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in a Theatre to ſee a ſight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Narſes</hi> laughed at the Letter, and the vanity of the <hi>Goths,</hi> and forthwith began his journey, leaving <hi>Juſtinus</hi> in <hi>Ravenna</hi> with a Garriſon. At <hi>Ariminum</hi> he found the Bridge newly taken up by the <hi>Goths,</hi> and his paſſage not eaſie; by the Bridge it ſelfe was never any paſſage but by one man a breaſt, unarmed and a foot, with much adoe, though none diſturbed; but now numbers oppoſing, it was not poſſible to ferry over. <hi>Narſes</hi> came to the place where the Bridge had been, and ſtudyed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome expedient in this difficulty. Thither came alſo <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſdrilas</hi> with ſome Horſe, to obſerve the <hi>Romans</hi> proceeding. A Souldier of <hi>Narſes</hi> let flye an Arrow amongſt them, and killed a Horſeman; whereat <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſdrilas</hi> removed in ſome haſte, and put himſelfe within the Towne, and immediately at another Gate ſallyed with others of his beſt men; thinking to take <hi>Narſes</hi> ſuddenly, and to cut him in peices, being now searching in another part of the River for a paſſage. But ſome <hi>Herulians</hi> by accident encountred, and killed him; and a <hi>Roman</hi> knowing him, brought his head to <hi>Narſes;</hi> which filled them with courage, to ſee God fight for them, and the <hi>Goths</hi> having a plot upon their Generall, to loſe their owne Commander ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not by any humane deſigne or providence. But <hi>Narſes</hi> medled not with <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum,</hi> though <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſdrilas</hi> were ſlaine, nor with any other Enemy-towne, that he might not retard his maine deſigne, nor diſtract it by any by-buſineſſe. And the Enemy in <hi>Ariminum,</hi> having loſt their Commander, gave no impediment to him in the making a Bridge, by which he paſt the River at his eaſe. He left <hi>Via Flaminia,</hi> and took the left hand way; for the Enemy had taken the ſtrong Rock of <hi>Petra pertuſa,</hi> deſcribed by me before, and all other pieces upon <hi>Via Flaminia,</hi> which made it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſable for the <hi>Romans;</hi> and therefore he left the ſhorter, and went the quieter way.</p>

About the place were many little round Hills, being the Tombs of the <hi>Gaules</hi> ſlaine by <hi>Camillus</hi> and the <hi>Romans,</hi> and they are to this day called <hi>Buſta Gallorum; Buſta</hi> in Latine being the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and reliques of a funerall Pile. <hi>Narſes</hi> ſent ſome unto <hi>Totilas</hi> to deſire him to to lay aſide Hoſtility, and to entertaine at laſt peaceable counſells, repreſenting how impoſſible it was for him, having under him but few men, and them not held together by any Law, to contend long with the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. And he direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Ambaſſadors, if they ſaw <hi>Totilas</hi> reſolved upon War, to bid him inſtantly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point a day for a pitcht Battell. They did acccordingly, and <hi>Totilas</hi> with a brave countenance told them, that by any means they muſt have Warr. Noble Sir, then quoth they, what time appoint you for the Battell? Eight dayes hence, quoth he, we will meet you. <hi>Narſes</hi> hearing this report from the Embaſſadors, ſuſpecting ſome cunning in <hi>Totilas,</hi> prepared, as to fight the next day: And he was in the right; for the next day <hi>Totilas</hi> came with his whole Army. And they lay one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the other about a flight ſhot off: Both parts had a minde to poſſeſſe a little Hill, to gaine advantage of upper ground to ſhoot downe on the Enemy, and there being alſo no beaten way to the <hi>Roman</hi> Campe but by that Hill (the Campe being compaſſed by thoſe round Hills I mentioned) they eſteemed it an important place, for the <hi>Goths</hi> to gaule the <hi>Romans</hi> every way, and for the <hi>Romans</hi> to prevent that inconvenience. <hi>Narſes</hi> in the night time ſent fifty choice men, who ſurprized the place, none oppoſing. Before the Hill, and neer the beaten way oppoſite to the <hi>Goths</hi> Quarters runs a Brook; by this the fifty <hi>Romans</hi> ſtood cloſe, body to body, putting themſelves into a ſquare forme. In the morning <hi>Totilas</hi> perceiving them, ſent a Troop of Horſe to beat them away; who rode againſt them furiouſly and with clamour, as if they would drive them away at the firſt onſet: But they ſtood thick and firme, and fenced cloſe with their Sheilds, which claſhing together, and charging their Lances in ſit time, all at once in order, they bravely reſiſted the <hi>Goths</hi> hot aſſault; frighting their Horſes with the noiſe of their Sheilds, and the men with the points of their Lances. The Horſes flew back, having ſpace enough to retire, and the men crying aloud to them, could not be heard; but were thus beaten off. They came on againe, and found the ſame entertainment, and went off; and failing often, in the end they gave it over. <hi>Totilas</hi> commanded out another Troop of Horſe, who ſped as the former, and ſo did others after that; and <hi>Totilas</hi> having tryed many Troops, and doing no good, in the end quitted the buſineſſe; whereby theſe fifty men got much reputation, but eſpecially <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Auſilas;</hi> who drawing their Cimiters, layd them before them; then made many ſhots upon the Enemy, which killed many both men and Horſes; and their Quivers being empty, they took up their Swords and Sheilds, and alone oppoſed the aſſailants, cutting off with their Swords their Lances heads. And <hi>Paul</hi> having bowed his Sword with cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Lances, he threw it away, and ſnatcht from the Enemy four Lances, and by his valour was the greateſt cauſe of their deſpairing. <hi>Narſes</hi> for this ſervice made him one of his Targeteirs. In the meane time both parts prepared for the Battell. <hi>Narſes</hi> ſpake thus to his Souldiers.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>When a Battell is to be with equall powers, happily it is neceſſary with encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements to get ſome advantage of the Enemy for the Victory: But you, fellow Souldiers! being to fight with men inferiour in valour, numbers, all kinde of preparations, need no more but with Gods propitious to begin this Battell. Ever then with your prayers making him your aſſiſtant, march on with a noble ſcorn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe theeves, the ancient Slaves of our Emperour, and now Fugitives; though for a time they have troubled us, having gotten to themſelves a Tyrant pickt out of their multitude. Indeed reaſoning probably, it is moſt ſtrange that theſe men ſhould ſo much as ſtand in ranck againſt us. They are weary of living, and like brutes and mad men run upon a manifeſt death; and from that reaſonleſſe reſolution, as they can have no hopes, ſo they care not what befalls them, being men brought hither by God to be puniſhed for their ill government. When men have a ſentence againſt them above, they run themſelves into their juſt chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:50471:151"/>You do likewiſe hazard in this Battell for a lawfull State, but they are Rebels, and ſtruggle againſt the Lawes. They thinke not to leave their eſtates to their Poſterity, and therefore live in momentany comforts, which they know will be loſt with their owne breath: So that they are to be deſpiſed. Men without Law and Government all good hopes faile, and Victory abandons, which uſes not to forſake the good cauſe.</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Totilas</hi> alſo, ſeeing his Troops apprehenſive of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, uſed this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I am now, fellow Souldiers! to make to you my laſt Speech; we ſhall need no more after this day, which certainly will conclude the fortune of the Warr. Both our ſelves and the <hi>Emperour</hi> are even ſo ſpent with toyles, fights, and other neceſſities, that he that beats his Enemy, ſhall have need to fight no more, and he that is beaten will have a faire excuſe to be quiet. When men reap from their affaires miſerable fruits, they dare no more returne to them, but even in occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions vehemently preſſing, their judgements ſtart back upon the memory of their former misfortunes. So that now it is you muſt fight, reſerve nor your valour for any other time, and endure now the labour, not preſerving your bodies for another hazard; and ſpare not Armes nor Horſes, as things that will no more be uſefull to you. Fortune having ruined all the reſt, hath left us this day as the utmoſt of our hopes. Uſe now your courage, venture boldly; our hopes hanging upon ſuch a haire, we muſt not be remiſſe for the leaſt moment of time. The point of opportunity being paſt, the greateſt endeavours afterward faile; the nature of theſe affaires not admitting ſtale valour; all muſt be unſeaſonable that comes after the occaſion. So that let us doe effectually now, that we may finde the benefit of what we doe, and aſſure our ſelves that running away is moſt ruinous. Men leave their rancks and flye, that they may live; but when flying brings certaine deſtruction, he that ſtands the danger is ſafer then he that flyes. And let us deſpiſe our Enemies, a mingled multitude of many Nations. Such Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiliaries are neither faithfull, nor powerfull. As they are of ſeverall Nations, they have ſeverall intentions alſo; and thinke not that the <hi>Hunnes, Herulians,</hi> and <hi>Lombards</hi> will hazard to the death, or eſteeme their lives at a leſſe rate then the <hi>Romans</hi> Money. They make a countenance of fighting, but will turne cowards when they pleaſe; either after receite of their payes, or upon their Commanders direction. The moſt agreeable things not done freely, but upon the neceſſity ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of compulſion or hire, pleaſe not, but become greivous at laſt. Conſider all this, and fight with alacrity.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Battells were thus put in order: they ſtood both in front, as deepe and as long as they could make it. The left wing of the <hi>Romans Narſes</hi> and <hi>John</hi> had, neer the Hill, with the choiceſt men of the Army, being both followed with many Lanciers and Targettiers, and excellent <hi>Hunnes,</hi> beſides their Souldiers on the Liſt. In the right wing were <hi>Valerianus, John Phagas,</hi> and <hi>Dagiſthaeus,</hi> with the reſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers. The Battalion was of eight thouſand foot, and the Archers of the Liſt; and between the ſame and both the wings were placed the <hi>Lombards, Herulians,</hi> and other <hi>Barbarians;</hi> all whom <hi>Narſes</hi> cauſed to alight from their Horſes, and to ſerve as footmen, that if they ſhould turne willing Cowards, they might flye but ſlowly. The left wing he put into the forme of a Wedge, and he ſet there fifteen hundred Horſe-men, whereof five hundred were to relieve the <hi>Romans,</hi> in caſe they ſhould be put to the worſt; and the other thouſand in the fight to get the backs of the Enemies foot, and to gaul them. <hi>Totilas</hi> placed his Army in like manner, and rode about, with his countenance and words animating his Souldiers. <hi>Narſes</hi> did the like, holding out to them gilt Chaines and Bridles, as the Prizes of their valour that day.</p>

               <p>BOth the Armies a while ſtood ſtill, expecting each their Enemies aſſault: Then a <hi>Goth</hi> named <hi>Cocas,</hi> much eſteemed for valour, rode up to the <hi>Roman</hi> Army,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:50471:152"/>challenging any to fight with him. He had been a <hi>Roman</hi> Souldier, and revolted to <hi>Totilas;</hi> to whom <hi>Anzalas</hi> an <hi>Armenian,</hi> and Lancier to <hi>Narſes</hi> rode out. <hi>Cocas</hi> ſpurd on to give the firſt blow with his Lance, ayming at his belly; <hi>Anzalas</hi> turn'd his Horſe aſide, and avoyded the blow, then thruſt his Lance into his left ſide, at which the <hi>Goth</hi> fell downe dead, and the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhouted. Then <hi>Totilas</hi> put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe between the Armies, not to fight a Duell, but to dally out the time, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the two thouſand Horſe to be at hand, untill whoſe coming he would put off the Battell. He concealed who he was, wearing a Gilt Armour, and from his Headpeice and Lance hung downe ſtreamers of purple; and he was a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant ſigh, being bravely horſt. He acted his feats of Armes skilfully, winding his Horſe round in a circle; then turning ſhort, and making many ſuch circular paſſages: He toſt his Lance into the ayre in his full carriere, then caught it as it came downe againe, and removing it skilfully from one hand to another, he took much pride in his dexterity therein; lying upon his back, and putting himſelfe upon his Buttocks and bowing this way and that way, like a Youth exactly taught all the tricks of a Dancing ſchoole. He ſpent a great part of the afternoone in theſe exerciſes; then to gaine more time, ſent to the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, offering a Parley. <hi>Narſes</hi> ſayd, he juggled, being before all for Warr, and now making Propoſitions when the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells were to joyne. In the meane time came the two thouſand Horſe, which when <hi>Totilas</hi> underſtood, and it being Dinner time, he cauſed the Army to draw off, and he went to his Tent; where in his owne quarter he found the two thouſand Horſe. He commanded his Troops to dine, and himſelfe put on another Armour, then led out ſuddenly againſt the Enemy, thinking to ſurprize them unprepared: But <hi>Narſes</hi> fearing what happened, forbade his men to retyre to their Dinner, or afternoons repoſe, or to put off their Corſlets, or to unbridle their Horſes; commanding them in their rancks, with their Armour on, to take a bit, and to have a perpetuall eye upon the Enemies returne. They ſtood in the ſame order ſtill, ſaving that <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> put both the wings, with an addition of four thouſand Foot, into the forme of a halfe moone.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Goths</hi> Infantry ſtood behinde their Horſe, to receive them being routed within their rancks, and joyntly to renue the charge. <hi>Totilas</hi> commanded his men, not to uſe their Arrows but their Lances; which ſenſleſſe ſtratagem ruined him, making hereby his Army inferiour in their offenſive weapons, as in all things elſe. For the <hi>Romans</hi> uſed, according to the occaſion, their Arrows and Lances, and came up to the Sword, and did all which the preſent occaſion required, either charging on Horſeback, or on foot, to their beſt advantage; and ſometimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing the Enemy, ſometimes ſtanding his charges. But the <hi>Goths</hi> Horſe, without their Foot, came on with unadviſed fury, truſting onely to their Lances; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the midſt of the <hi>Romans,</hi> they found their errour, being ingaged among eight thouſand Foot: By whom being gaulled on all ſides, they deſpaired: Our Archers drawing home the two ends of their Bowes even to their foreheads, and round like a halfe moon; ſo that the <hi>Goths,</hi> before they could touch the <hi>Romans</hi> Horſe, had loſt many men and Horſes. And after much miſcheife ſuſtained, they came late up to the <hi>Romans</hi> Battalion of Horſe; where the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Auxiliaries</hi> ſtrove with equall valour, each one receiving the Enemy bravely, and repelling them. Then the Evening coming on, the <hi>Goths</hi> began to retyre, and the <hi>Romans</hi> to purſue; the <hi>Goths</hi> being not able to ſtand after their firſt furious charge, but turning about in confuſion, daunted with the <hi>Romans</hi> numbers and good order: And they gave o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fighting; thinking that ſome Spirits fell upon them, and that Heaven it ſelfe fought againſt them. When they came to their Foot, there their miſcheife encreaſed; for they came not in any orderly retreat, as to take breath for a new charge, or for any other point of Warr, but ran in among them ſo confuſedly, ſpoyling many, that they opened not their rancks to receive them, but ran away with them for company, and it growing darke they deſtroyed one another. The <hi>Romans</hi> killed them in this feare, ſparing none, and none daring to look them in the faces, who expoſing themſelves to their Enemies, were purſued with terrours, and maſtered with cowardiſe. Six thouſand were ſlaine, and many taken Priſoners, and not long after put to the Sword. Among them periſhed many <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers, who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted to <hi>Totilas.</hi> And now the darkneſſe concluded the fight. <hi>Totilas</hi> fled in the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:50471:152"/>darke with five men, of whom <hi>Skipuar</hi> was one; he was purſued by ſome <hi>Romans,</hi> who knew him not; among whom was <hi>Aſbades</hi> a <hi>Gepaede,</hi> who had overtaken him, and was making a blow at him: but a <hi>Gothiſh</hi> Boy following his flying Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, cryed out, Thou Dog! Doeſt thou run after thine owne Maſter to kill him? But <hi>Aſbades</hi> thruſt his Lance forcibly into <hi>Totilas,</hi> and was himſelfe hurt in the foot by <hi>Skipuar,</hi> that he could follow no further; <hi>Skipuar</hi> alſo being wounded, ſtood ſtill: And the foure men with <hi>Aſbades</hi> followed no further, but carryed off <hi>Aſbades.</hi> Thoſe who accompanyed <hi>Totilas</hi> rode on amaine (thinking the Enemy purſued ſtill) and drew him after them, mortally wounded, and ready to expire. Having run about ten miles, they came to a Towne called <hi>Caprae;</hi> there they reſted, and dreſſed the wound of <hi>Totilas,</hi> who ſoon after gave up the ghoſt: There they buryed him and went away. Such a concluſion of his life and raigne had <hi>Totilas,</hi> having been King of the <hi>Goths</hi> eleven yeares; an end not ſuitable to his former a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and ſucceſſes. Fortune in him inſulted upon the fraile condition of man, ſhewing her ſtrange proceeding, and abſolute will. Shee had without any apparent merit beſtowed on <hi>Totilas</hi> a long time of happineſſe; and now upon the ſudden ſhe hurryed him at her owne pleaſure into cowardiſe, and an ignoble death. Theſe are things to men incomprehenſible, but in all ages have been diſcourſed of accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to mens conceits and fancies, to comfort their ignorance with ſome ſeeming probabilities. But the <hi>Romans</hi> knew not of the death of <hi>Totilas,</hi> till a Gothiſh wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man told it, and ſhewed his Grave; who diſtruſting the report, opened the Grave, digged up the Coffin, and took out the body, and finding it to be <hi>Totilas,</hi> they put him into the ground againe, and reported all to <hi>Narſes.</hi> Some report this over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw otherwiſe, that the <hi>Goths</hi> did not make that unadviſed retreat; but that in the firſt skirmiſhing with the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſuddenly an Arrow, and by chance lighted upon <hi>Totilas.</hi> For being armed like a common Souldier, and rancked among them in the Battalion to conceale himſelfe, he could not be knowne, nor purpoſely ſhot at. But that being mortally wounded, in great paine he gallopt away with ſome few with him to <hi>Caprae,</hi> and, after much miſery and languiſhing, dyed under the cure. And that the <hi>Goths</hi> amazed to ſee their King thus mortally wounded, and gone off, being otherwiſe too weak, then became wholly out of heart, and fell into that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment and ſhamefull running away.</p>

               <p>BUT howſoever this fell out; <hi>Narſes</hi> rejoycing at the ſucceſſe, took the True courſe, to attribute all unto God: And he took order in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occaſions; and firſt, to be rid of his unrulely <hi>Lombards,</hi> who were infinitely diſorderly, and burned houſes, and raviſhed Women that fled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Churches. He beſtowed ſtore of money on them for their Service, and ſent them home; commanding <hi>Valerianus,</hi> and <hi>Damianus,</hi> his Siſters Son, with their Troops to conduct them out of the <hi>Roman</hi> Confines, that they might do no miſchiefe in their way home-ward. And ſo ſoon as theſe were out of the <hi>Roman</hi> Territories, <hi>Valerianus</hi> beſieged <hi>Verona;</hi> and the Garriſon in it came to ſome Capitulation with him for rendring the Town: But the <hi>Francks</hi> Garriſon'd in the Townes of <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> hindred it, ſeeking with all their endeavour to get the whole Country to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; whereupon <hi>Valerianus</hi> retired without effecting any thing.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Goths</hi> who fled from the overthrow, went over the River <hi>Poe,</hi> and put themſelves into the City of <hi>Picenum,</hi> and other Townes about it, and made <hi>Teias</hi> their King. He with the Treaſures left by <hi>Totilas</hi> in <hi>Picenum,</hi> ſought to draw the <hi>Francks</hi> to his aide, and governed the <hi>Goths</hi> as he could in that Eſtate, aſſembling them together. <hi>Narſes</hi> advertiſed thereof, commanded <hi>Valerianus</hi> to keep his Troops about the River <hi>Poe,</hi> to make the <hi>Goths</hi> rallying difficult: Himſelfe with the reſt of the Army marcht towards <hi>Rome.</hi> In <hi>Tuſcany</hi> he took in <hi>Narnia,</hi> and put a Garriſon into <hi>Spoletum,</hi> with direction to reedifie the Walls demoliſhed by the <hi>Goths.</hi> He ſent Troops alſo to attempt <hi>Peruſia,</hi> commanded by two Fugitive <hi>Romans, Meligedius,</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lithus;</hi> who being one of the Life-guard to <hi>Cyprianus,</hi>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:50471:153"/>was wonne by the allurements of <hi>Totilas</hi> to murther him, Commander of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Garriſon there. <hi>Melegedius</hi> accepted the offers of <hi>Narſes,</hi> and conſulted with his own Followers to yeild the Town; which <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lithus</hi> with his Friends openly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, was ſlain in the Fight, and the Town was rendred to the <hi>Romans.</hi> Thus by Gods juſt Vengeance was <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lithus</hi> ſlain in the very place, where he had murthered his Commander <hi>Cyprianus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Goths</hi> Garriſon'd in <hi>Rome,</hi> hearing of the approach of <hi>Narſes,</hi> put in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe to encounter him, as they could. At his firſt taking <hi>Rome, Totilas</hi> had burnt moſt of the Buildings of the City; and then conſidering how the <hi>Goths</hi> had not men enough left to Guard the whole Circuit of it, he took in with a leſſer Wall a ſmall part thereof, about <hi>Adrians</hi> Tomb, joyn'd it to the City Walls, and ſo made it as a Caſtle; wherein the <hi>Goths</hi> laid their things of Value, and guarded it careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, neglecting the reſt of the Walls. Yet then deſirous to try the Enemy, they left a few to guard that Caſtle, and put themſelves upon the Battlements. The Circuite of <hi>Rome</hi> ſo vaſt neither could the <hi>Romans</hi> encompaſſe, nor the <hi>Goths</hi> guard; ſo that the aſſaults, and defences were accidentally in ſeverall places, as the occaſions were. <hi>Narſes</hi> charged one part with multitudes of Archers; in another <hi>John,</hi> Siſters Son to <hi>Vitalianus,</hi> fell on with his Troops. Another part <hi>Philimuth</hi> and his <hi>Herulians</hi> infeſted, and they were far diſtant from one another: the <hi>Goths</hi> bravely reſiſting their Charges; and being aſſembled all where the <hi>Romans</hi> fell on, the reſt of the Walls were empty. <hi>Dagiſthaeus,</hi> with <hi>Narſes</hi> conſent, took ſome Troopes with the Enſignes of <hi>Narſes,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> and ſcaling Ladders, and ſet upon a part quite deſtitute of Guards, and at his eaſe he mounted by his Ladders, none reſiſting; and then ſet upon the Gates: the <hi>Goths</hi> ſeeing this, left their Guards and ran all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; ſome to their new Caſtle, others to <hi>Portus.</hi> Writing this, it comes into my thoughts, how Fortune plaies with poor men; changing her looks with the times and places, and varying ſuddenly not only her own humour, but even the value and worth of the men. <hi>Beſſas</hi> formerly loſt <hi>Rome</hi> unworthily, and afterward recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Petra</hi> in <hi>Lazica</hi> very bravely. And on the contrary, <hi>Dagiſthaeus</hi> poorly ran a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from <hi>Petra,</hi> and now ſoon after recovers <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelfe to the Emperour. Theſe things have been done from the beginning, and will be, while there is Fortune a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men. <hi>Narſes</hi> then marcht againſt the new Caſtle; But the <hi>Goths</hi> yeilded it and themſelves,<note place="margin">Anno <hi>26. Juſt. Rome</hi> now had been taken five times in his Raigne.</note> upon aſſurances for their Perſons; <hi>Juſtinian</hi> being now in the 26th. yeare of his Reigne. Thus was <hi>Rome</hi> taken five times in his Reigne, and <hi>Narſes</hi> ſent the Keyes of it to the Emperour. To the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate and People, this Victory proved an extream ruine; So to men that muſt have a miſchiefe, even their ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good Fortunes turn to their deſtruction; that having had a faire courſe, they both loſe it, and undo themſelves. For the <hi>Goths,</hi> now deſpairing of the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Italy,</hi> in their flight killed all the <hi>Romans</hi> they found; And the <hi>Barbarians</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army alſo, at their entring the City, uſed them all as Enemies. Many Senators alſo confined by <hi>Totilas</hi> in <hi>Campania,</hi> and now repairing to <hi>Rome</hi> (when they heard it to be in the Emperours poſſeſſion) the <hi>Goths</hi> quartered in the Townes of thoſe parts, killed, and left not one <hi>Patritian</hi> alive. <hi>Maximus</hi> was then ſlain, whom I have mentioned formerly. <hi>Totilas</hi> alſo, going againſt <hi>Narſes,</hi> called for all the Sons of the principall <hi>Romans,</hi> and chooſing out 300. of the goodlieſt of them, pretending to breed them, but indeed holding them for Hoſtages: And he ſent them beyond the River <hi>Poe;</hi> whom <hi>Teias</hi> now finding there, killed them all.</p>
               <p>Moreover, <hi>Ragnaris</hi> a <hi>Goth,</hi> who commanded in <hi>Tarentum,</hi> and had compounded with <hi>Bacurius,</hi> (as I have ſaid) to yield the City to the Emperour, and given ſix <hi>Goths</hi> for Hoſtages: Now hearing of the Election of <hi>Teias,</hi> and that the <hi>Francks</hi> were deſired to aide him, and he immediately to march againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to perform the compoſition; and to get his Hoſtages again, he ſent one to <hi>Bacurius</hi> for a convoy of Souldiers to <hi>Otranto,</hi> from whence (he ſaid) he would go to <hi>Conſtantinople. Bacurius,</hi> not ſuſpecting his plot, ſent him 50. men, whom <hi>Ragnaris</hi> impriſoned, and ſent word to <hi>Bacurius,</hi> that if he meant to have his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, he muſt reſtore to him his <hi>Gothiſh</hi> Hoſtages. <hi>Bacurius</hi> led out his Forces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, leaving ſome few to guard <hi>Otranto.</hi> Upon this <hi>Ragnaris</hi> killed the 50. Souldiers, and ſallied out againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> and in fight was defeated, loſt many men, and ran away into <hi>Acherontia, Tarentum</hi> being blockt up by the <hi>Romans.</hi> The

But the <hi>Francks</hi> took the reſolution beſt for themſelves, not to beſtow their lives upon <hi>Goths</hi> nor <hi>Romans,</hi> but to adventure them onely in the Conqueſt of <hi>Italy</hi> for themſelves.</p>

               <p>BUT <hi>Narſes</hi> (hearing how <hi>Totilas</hi> had layed the moſt part of his Treaſures in the Caſtle of <hi>Cuma</hi> in <hi>Campania,</hi> with a ſtrong Garriſon under his owne Brother &amp; <hi>Herodian</hi>) ſent to beſiege the ſayd Caſtle, ſtaying himſelfe at <hi>Rome</hi> to repaire the ruines, and ſent others to beſiege <hi>Centumcellae. Teias</hi> fearing the loſſe of this <hi>Caſtle,</hi> and the Treaſures; and having no hope from the <hi>Francks,</hi> commanded his Troops to be ready for a Battell with the <hi>Romans. Narſes</hi> finding his intention, commanded <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Philemuth,</hi> to martch with their Forces into <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> to ſtop the Enemies paſſage into <hi>Campania,</hi> and to aſſiſt in the taking of <hi>Cuma.</hi> But <hi>Teias</hi> left his neerer way, which was to the right hand, and made a huge compaſſe; paſſing along the Sea coaſt of the <hi>Jonian Gulfe</hi> into <hi>Campania. Narſes</hi> thereof advertiſed, remanded <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Philemuth,</hi> and ſent for <hi>Valerianus,</hi> who beſieged <hi>Petra-Pertuſa,</hi> and with his whole Army, in order to fight, martcht into <hi>Campania. Mount Veſuvius</hi> in <hi>Campania</hi> (as I have ſayd before) often ſends out a noiſe like the lowing of Oxen, which is ever accompanied with a vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of huge quantity of Cynders. Beſides (as <hi>Mount Aetna</hi> in <hi>Sicily</hi>) in the middle it hath made it ſelfe hollow from the top to the bottome, and below the fire burnes perpetually: The fire is ſo deep, that peeping in from the top, you cannot eaſily diſcerne it. When the Mountaine vomits, the flame forces off peices of rocks from the higheſt ridges of it, ſhooting up the ſmaller pieces farr above the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and ſcattering the greater round about. From the top alſo of this Mountain runs a Torrent of fire to the foot of it, and ſomething further, as in <hi>Mount Aetna.</hi> This fiery ſtream on either ſide makes high bancks, undermining the ground below; and when the flame comes upon it, it lookes like a flood of water ſet on fire. So ſoon as the flame is quencht the ſtream ſtops its courſe; and the Sediment or Lees of that fiery ſubſtance looks like dry Mud, and heaps of Cynders. At the foot of the Mountaine are wholeſome Springs, from which comes the River <hi>Draco</hi> cloſe to the City of <hi>Nuceria:</hi> On either ſide of this River both Armies encamped; it hath a ſmall ſtream but not to be paſt, being deep, as having worne out the ground under the bancks very low. The Bridge which is upon it the <hi>Goths</hi> had gotten, and being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped neer it, they had made upon it wooden Towers, and many Engines, and ſet up <hi>Baliſtas</hi> to ſhoot downe upon the Enemy. This River being ſuch, there was no poſſibility for a cloſe ſtanding Battell. So that each part got as neer as they durſt to the banks, and plyed one another with Arrows. Some Duels there were alſo, ſometimes <hi>Romans</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Goths</hi> paſting over the Bridge, and challenging all comers. Two moneths were thus conſumed; and while the <hi>Goths</hi> were Maſters of the Sea, their Campe being neer the Sea, was ſupplyed with proviſions: But after the <hi>Romans</hi> had gotten their Shipps by the Treaſon of the Commander of them a <hi>Goth,</hi> and were re-enforced alſo with many other Ships out of <hi>Sicily</hi> and other <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Dominions; and that <hi>Narſes</hi> had ſet up wooden Towers upon the Rivers bank, the <hi>Goths</hi> hearts were abſolutely dejected; and for feare and famine were faine to flye up to a Mountaine neer there, called <hi>Mons Lactis.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> for the faſtneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes could not come at them: But the <hi>Goths</hi> being there in more want, and having no way to get any proviſion for themſelves or their Horſes, repenting their coming up, and chooſing rather to dye by fight then to ſtarve, came ſuddenly upon the <hi>Romans,</hi> who ſtood againſt them as they could, being taken unexpectedly, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing embattailed, nor under their ſeverall Captaines; not any way in order, nor at all obſerving what was commanded them. The <hi>Goths</hi> quitted their Horſes, and ſtood in a deep Battalion; the <hi>Romans</hi> left their Horſes and ſtood in front likewiſe. This
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:50471:154"/>fight, and the valour of <hi>Teias</hi> in it, deſerves a long diſcourſe; being equall to that of the ancient <hi>Heroes.</hi> Deſpaire made the <hi>Goths</hi> venture all, and the <hi>Romans</hi> ſtood them, though ſeeing them mad, yet aſhamed to yeild to beaten men; and ſo the one weary of their lives, the other for demonſtration of valour, fought with much fury, beginning in the morning betimes. <hi>Teias</hi> accompanied with ſome few ſtood in the firſt ranck in open view, holding out his Sheild and ſhaking his Lance. A great number of <hi>Romans</hi> knowing that by his fall the Battell would be ended, combined themſelves againſt him, ſome charging, ſome throwing their darts at him. Which he received all upon his Shield, and then ſlew out, and killed many. His Sheild being ſtuck thick with Darts, he gave it to one of his Targetiers and took another. He continued thus a third part of the day, when he had twelve Darts ſticking on his Sheild, that he could not move it as he would, nor beat off the Aſſailants. Yet he quitted not his ranck, nor gave the Enemy an inch of ground; he did not ſo much as turne his body, or reſt his back upon his Sheild; but ſtood upright, as if he were pitcht into the ground, killing with his right hand, and warding with his Sheild; and calling by name his Targetier to give him a new Sheild, for his old was loaded with Darts. And in that inſtant, his breaſt lying open, was hit with a Javelin, upon which he immediately dyed. The Souldiers put his head upon a long Pole, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to encourage the <hi>Romans,</hi> and to cauſe the <hi>Goths</hi> to deſpaire, and to quit the fight. But the <hi>Goths,</hi> though they ſaw their King ſlaine, yet gave it not over, and at night both retyred, and lay in their Armour. Early the next day they began again, and fought till night, not turning to any ſide, nor giving back; and though many were loſt, yet their ſavage hatred held them ſtill buckled to one another: The <hi>Goths</hi> knowing it to be their laſt fight, and the <hi>Romans</hi> diſdaining to be overmatcht. At laſt the <hi>Goths</hi> ſent Agents to <hi>Narſes,</hi> to tell him; That they perceived their fight to be with God himſelfe, and ſaw the power which ſtood againſt them; and their true eſtate now, by their former ſucceſſe; that they would lay aſide deſperate reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, upon condition not to be put under the ſubjection of the <hi>Emperour,</hi> but to live free with ſome other <hi>Barbarian</hi> Nation. They intreated the <hi>Romans</hi> alſo to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford them a peaceable retreat, and in a moderate conſideration of their fortune, to beſtow their owne Goods upon them for their journey, ſuch as they had left in any Caſtles of <hi>Italy. Narſes</hi> held a conſultation hereupon, where <hi>John</hi> adviſed him to grant the Petition, and to contend no more with men weary of their lives, nor to ſtirr a courage growing from deſperation, which commonly proves fatall, both to the men poſſeſſed with it, and to ſuch as encounter them. To moderate men (quoth he) it is enough to be Victorious, whereas the deſire of too much may end in ſome inconvenience. <hi>Narſes</hi> allowing the advice, they agreed upon conditions. That the <hi>Goths</hi> ſhould have their Goods, and immediately go out of <hi>Italy;</hi> and that they ſhould never bear Armes againſt the <hi>Romans.</hi> About a thouſand <hi>Goths</hi> of this Company went away to <hi>Picenum,</hi> and the parts beyond the River <hi>Poe,</hi> commanded by <hi>Ildulph</hi> and ſome others; the reſidue ſtayd and ratified this agreement by their oaths: And the <hi>Romans</hi> took in <hi>Cuma</hi> and all the reſt.
